Obama made Obama more receptive to Netanyahu .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about implementation of the international agreement and more about destabilizing action in the Middle East .
in denial , however , there is also to conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ two @-@ state @-@ owned states .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been set for years .
Washington criticized Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and raises Netanyahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the Obama deal of Iran &apos;s nuclear program has worsened the two &apos;s relationship with the two .
in March , Netanyahu had kept the Republican invitation to the US Congress - a controversial speech - that was regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting that was rejected by the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor who has shot his friend at a shot have shot his friend .
in an emergency call , professor Sh@@ h@@ on Lam@@ b with a little voice with the police that he had shot his friend , and that he would have to come to his house .
Lam@@ b was important to emphasize that his dog is likely to be a dog , but still more le@@ le@@ and , and he said that the family of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
the delta University at the University of State _UNK n Bu@@ ford said that the university &apos;s name - the panel &apos;s staff - has heard the 10 : 18 clock .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous emergency call .
until the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took place when the police turned him into him .
one day after the shooting university , students , and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to provide an image of what was motivated by Lam@@ b .
the details of the two states published in the details of the details , like students and staff who knew him , helped provide an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were in his teaching .
the police , where p@@ ren@@ ti@@ died , said that he did not have a history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book mentioned in his book , he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people ; &quot; he shared his academic life .
both were under@@ attended in the social sciences and history whose faculty include 17 members , and many students visited both .
at the same time , there were some proc@@ vi@@ ties to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ on Be@@ b , told the lam@@ b , he seemed to be a little and nervous , and whether something wrong with him was wrong .
another student , micro@@ sy@@ el , said that Lam@@ m told him that he had to do with the end of 2014 in 2014 .
Lam@@ b had previously asked the delta State University to ask for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem .
this year , he was founded only two online failures - the budget prices .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the samples for the Lam@@ b had worked so hard for him to guarantee an automatic way for an automatic way to establish his position as the case .
the university University - President William William For@@ ge said nothing of a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something something in the lam@@ b lam@@ b .
these are questions , the lam@@ b cannot answer .
after the run @-@ out , the police later found the lam@@ b when he returned to Ar@@ si@@ i Ar@@ pp@@ i .
his car went into travel .
it was not immediately clear why the lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up .
Lam@@ b began his work in 2009 , which began 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 1@@ 2,000 people , and created geography and ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ cs .
he worked in the spring in P@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends of the lam@@ b described him as intelligent , charismatic , and used .
Car@@ la H@@ ash@@ ston said that she was 15 and Lam@@ m , when she met with common friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the co@@ co@@ ole cand@@ l , who tried some years to match the prison game .
he was then women &apos;s black black .
all girls , when he was &quot; he was , &quot; said .
Lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ b were obviously a time .
in the emergency call , Lam@@ b was killed ; I killed my wife ; but there was no sign of marriage .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ ing , who lived with them in the B@@ lit@@ y@@ stein , who lived to a house in the White House .
the police said that the dog was order .
the former judge - the husband husband of P@@ ren@@ ti@@ , Sha@@ ti@@ O &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; said that they were 15 years ago , but had remained friends and had a daughter , who had now been 19 years old .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;

8 poll numbers show that Donald Rumsfeld is serious .
some have tried to dismiss him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republicans try to draw on the top polls from the top polls ( nor does ) work .
ten of the last 11 national polls showed a double @-@ digit area , and some are beginning to ask seriously what it means for the chances of real estate - The Mo@@ gh@@ al .
of course , it is too early in the electoral term .
no one claims that it is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts emphasize that , at this time in 2011 , the political leadership was made to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which only won a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would fight for a general election .
but outsider groups like Bush &apos;s super @-@ PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Group for Growth are now recognizing that they are now able to plunge their wealth and begin to topple him .
here , some current poll numbers suggest that real estate is not just a temporary phase : Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
credit ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before he announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a poll poll poll by Mon@@ t@@ ine University showed that only two of ten Republican Republicans saw real estate - The Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % were 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Rumsfeld .
about three of ten say they have negative negative opinion .
and these numbers hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac Peace vote last week found that 60 % of Republicans have a good sense of spin .
two thirds of the O@@ O@@ P - O@@ G@@ O@@ P ) would be happy with candidates as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / O@@ C last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they would be either . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
only two of 10 say they would be angry ; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm as 43 % ( 43 % say that they would be , &amp; # 160 ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the next enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ er , with only 21 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they are unhappy . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t look like a problem as a problem .
the same number is true in the nation &apos;s first election state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a figure for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he did not have the personality to carry office effectively , and almost six of 10 Independent Independent argue that his temper@@ ament is not the White House in the White House .
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea .
if they put their training , Republican voters are real in real terms .
if they are asked , who is most likely to win , the G@@ O@@ P nomination , after a poll by CNN / O@@ C last week , is four that the best bet is the best bet .
this is a change since the four late July four of its money at the end of July .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P voters , in the past , had not had the most clear ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four ten Republicans thought that the Republican nomination would gain only 28 % for the final candidates of Mitt Romney .
yet it shows that a multip@@ licity of G@@ O@@ P is plausible .
even if Republicans turned themselves to another candidate , almost everyone is heading .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the leadership , while the anti @-@ to @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ of @-@ a @-@ dozen @-@ dozen candidates are distributed more than a dozen other candidates .
but a poll poll poll in Mon@@ - Mon@@ tic University - shows that , in the beginning of the beginning of the early September , the result - to be put on the way - of the United States &quot; head @-@ on @-@ winning race , between spin and most other Republican candidates , has a multi @-@ party support .
he has a 13 @-@ point margin , before Mar@@ co E@@ ina , before Mar@@ co Wal@@ ar , 15 @-@ 15 points ago , before Bush was 19 points before Bush , and after all , John Paul Paul , John Defense , and Chris Christian .
it is a head - to judge - his head of his head - the race race with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would out@@ strip the businessmen with 19 points - in a hypothetical way - to be put in place - his head @-@ on @-@ winning race .
a narrow majority of Donald its - The Re@@ spin - says that they have formed their opinion .
a new poll by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T &apos;s poll shows that slightly more than half of the voters who support the spin , say they have their votes .
of course , much can happen to change , and no one can really say that no one can change opinion .
46 % said that they allow the door to change other candidates .
yet the strongest competition is the strongest moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ och@@ och@@ g Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice so often for spin .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with immigration .

but after the new A@@ BC / post @-@ Mon@@ day poll , six Republicans say that they say that they are linked to immigration issues .
so long as immigration is in the spotlight , it will seem to do so .
frustration over the government has soared to new highs .
Donald Car@@ d@@ son and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially by their maver@@ ick .
six of 10 Republicans say in the new mon@@ day - the survey by A@@ BC / Post - wants a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .

plans to reform the current referee process see that the EU is looking at the EU - the United States and the US - together with independent judges for a new investment court .
they are supposed to come from the EU , the US , and from third states .
this is the first time for a second resort .
it would allow it to speak against judgments .
so far , the procedure agreed on each other on the referee , a choice against whose judgments were not .
in the discussion of recent months , citizens had become clear that citizens of the old @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ of @-@ old bankruptcy system - a system of fairness and justice un@@ trusted , celebrated Mal@@ m@@ m .
in the long run , they want to work on a national investment court .
for example , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU could be resolved .
above all , the large @-@ scale investor @-@ owned investor - the default - was the main reason to apply to the bankruptcy process , as a major reason for Europe &apos;s great opposition .
traditional referee courts will be criticized by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , on the expense of taxpayers , and can enforce national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first statements , the anti @-@ bank - the T@@ T@@ T@@ C - T@@ amp@@ s , organizations like C@@ amp@@ y , called for the EU &apos;s proposals - the Commission &apos;s proposals - insufficient .
most importantly , they should not apply to the Free Trade Agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
Germany &apos;s economic secretary secretary of power ( SPD ) , on the other hand , calls for great progress .
the Commission account for fundamental reform points that federal Secretary of State Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel had worked out in the spring of the EU with other the EU .
the old system of private referee courts was the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Mal@@ m@@ m .
Europe &apos;s corporate business model warned about limiting the economy by too many new rules .
small and medium @-@ term companies could be put at a disadvantage .
when talks about the Free Trade Agreement ( Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear .
negotiations have run since mid @-@ 2013 .
but the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
the agreement should be a framework for the end of this year .

however , analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that , 12 months after opening his first markets , around five % of the food market will fall away in these two states , but will take place mainly on self @-@ serving retailers .
one of this week , according to the published analysis , estimated that I@@ er@@ an@@ Morgan Stanley , according to I@@ G@@ A , could lose $ 250 million per year per year and metals $ 250 million until the end of 2016 .
this prediction rests on the assumption that Al@@ di next year opens 25 branches in S@@ a and 30 in the next year , and will reach $ 500 million to $ 600 million in any market .
the loss of food and food prices , and the amounts of high @-@ cost metals , could cost roughly $ 13 million a profit from interest rates and taxes , told Ki@@ ath .
at the same time , metals share market share in the East states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ , though a recently conducted poll by Ro@@ y Morgan found that I@@ G@@ A is the test .

Europe &apos;s public crisis : Hungary , the border , keeps refugees back back , keeps refugees back back to refugees .
Hungary was declared emergency , and held the southern border with Serbia , and held everyone who tried to stop the country illegal , with all the aim of stopping the flow of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants were engaged in a kidney country , and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
the people who have fled violence fled for an unknown time in a street between the two countries &quot; two control points and built up .

when a police station took more hu@@ g@@ ers about them , the migrants would open the border ! &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .

the announcement of emergency emergency officials in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis , so that they could accelerate the streets and accelerate asylum seekers .

election -
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the national nomination , but Senator Berlin never wins .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic voters ( 58 % ) , while S@@ other is second , with 27 % ( rise by 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not announced whether he is running for presidency , receives 15 % of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters .
more than five months before the start , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear what candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant in their choice than the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S @-@ B@@ S - The News poll - The Clinton poll lost a series of demographic groups , while S@@ S@@ E had lost some profits .
Clinton holds a big margin for women and moderates , but this surge has reduced .
their support for men has fallen sharply , and S@@ 5 is just back on 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage among democratic voters below 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now equal .
Clinton , however , has a big margin for the older voters .
last month , Clinton was different from the lead to liberals , but Saleh has now now a 5 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 issue .
about half of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters , say , that they would support Clinton if she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some support , and 15 % would support them only because they are the candidate .
six % would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about their current supporters .
the views are stronger among those who do not support Clinton - only one quarter would support them .
while 48 % of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters say that they support Clinton , fewer Republican voters say about their top candidates ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned her link with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
consent to dealing with problems and predictability is also quoted .
because the vice president wants to raise the potential for the presidency , 57 % of democratic voters see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do .
if democratic voters asked , who would be asked for their second election , Biden is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Biden would be far from different .
as Biden decides not to run for the Democrats &quot; nomination , Clinton &apos;s Clinton margin is increasing , from 20 points with Biden on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ 50 % of democratic voters see Clinton as the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure has declined from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second gap with this measure , but the percentage that it sees as the question of the electorate has risen .
nevertheless , when asked what candidates are more important , Democratic voters call questions about voting predictability .
like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters are unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good outcomes among voters of their party .
majorities consider Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden to be honest and trustworthy , and with strong leadership .
Biden &apos;s three candidates are best at honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty % of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice so many say that this is different ( 15 % ) , but 27 % did not agree with him .
democratic voters in general , too , generally see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden in accordance with their views .
all of these measures , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters , has no different opinion .
but there is another story in America &apos;s general public .
half the Americans are now unhappy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that e @-@ mail &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; The controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton , though 36 % said that her opinion has worsened her opinion .
they are mostly Republicans , more than six from 10 to say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
62 % of the election is not a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electoral election is not as honest as honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and , however , get good leadership .
the six candidates , Car@@ son , Car@@ son , Car@@ son , and Bush are best at honesty .
a majority looks rather than honest , but , like Car@@ son , many have no view of him .
the rate of error for the test of 3@@ 51 Democratic Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son continues to move close to Donald Car@@ d@@ son , according to Donald Car@@ son .
Ben Car@@ son is in the recent poll by CB@@ S / New York Times in the recent poll behind Donald The Times .
the two candidates now account for half the support of voters in the new poll , and others are losing dramatically over time , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support the large number of voters , with support growing by 23 % in the last CB@@ S - the survey poll carried out by Fox &apos;s debate last month , by 27 % in the poll .
but Car@@ son soared from 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the poll also revealed that Car@@ son in demographic groups matters well and out@@ perform Republican voters with higher education .
former Florida , the former governor of Florida - the governor of the governor of Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ can@@ al Hu@@ ab@@ ine and Florida - - Senator Mar@@ co Ru@@ ers - are with 6 % in the third place .
the feu@@ d test of 3@@ 76 voters in this latest poll is plus or min@@ us 6 % , and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / O@@ C , published last week , shows that the poll published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the polls - the 19 % support for the Republicans , behind 32 % support .
the recent poll by A@@ BC / Washington Post , too , showed clear before Car@@ son .
at a look at the last week , Car@@ son found a few ways for some former neur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son apologized to question their faith .

that will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
interest rates will come , and the house will fal@@ se , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it last , and how long it will last .
in particular , history for the economy is only low .
recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness at interest rates is often often , if not always , one factor how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , the US Federal Reserve &apos;s representatives have been so severe - that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather for the period that is needed for normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole excitement might be exaggerated because of interest rates .
by contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradual return of the US - to normal interest rates - but still at low levels to lead to the s@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
but this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trend based on how some areas of economics could respond :
as the market has seen last month , the withdrawal of interest rates can make things volatile for a while .
once the increase is true , influence is not so dramatic .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to emerge later in the cycle and begin to reduce the return .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote interest rates .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that did not before and accelerate recession .
most remarkable here is that GDP will be near its lowest interest rate hike in the Fed &apos;s interest rate hike .
according to Deutsche Bank , 1@@ 18 interest rates since 1950 was just below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will continue , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter of Atlanta .
interest rates in so fragile economic classes may be risky , and raise the question of whether this time is different ; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have taken the Fed &apos;s interest rate on the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes have been targeted at the Federal Reserve meeting in this week , which ends the day .
while many strategists and economists believe that the M@@ M@@ C could approve an increase in this session , the futures price is only 25 % .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession was launched .
the current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months and so far 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , because the market is pre @-@ fixed , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the cycle of bond yields , the Deutsche Bank said immediately .
Charles Charles &apos;s strategists believe that interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds , leading to a flat act .
interesting to be said , markets are already changing in the Fed - the Fed &apos;s strategy - has adjusted for its expectations .
&quot; the decline of the dollar &apos;s strength , and the decline in inflationary expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy ; it wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the cur@@ ve is flat , lending has widened , and volatility has increased - all of the market if the Fed has exacerbated its strategy .
big and entire businesses will benefit companies that benefit the larger part of their business activity when interest rates rise and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debts .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
firms with strong balance sheet , with the weak balance sheet exceeded 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital - capital yields , as well as lower volatility in their shares , met with their counterparts with lower quality ( percentage percentage points ) and 3 percentage points ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher returns , even if experts believe that it will occur quickly .
BBC radio 3 is a copy of C@@ de F@@ M , a member of Andrew F@@ gh@@ y , says ,

BBC the BBC - Director of the BBC director pointed back the charges and argued that the BBC &apos;s radio will go far before its commercial competitors , when it comes to live with live music - music music and the public .
what I call radio 3 , which I will learn nowhere about classical music .

early this year , the BBC argued radio 3 @-@ 3 Alan ey that he must work harder to engage in the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .

the defendants are not guilty .
one was accused of abuse of power .
of this charge , he has been acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process has been deferred .
according to Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el had turned out to turn out that the defendants in 2006 @-@ 2011 had been used by the money accounts for which they were allowed to be used in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at roughly 400,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial finance .
this fact left the head of the opening San@@ en@@ r , President Mik@@ heil San@@ en@@ z .
it is supposed to be negotiated later .
the defense of the unknown was the defense that no wealth was born at any time .

then he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
that was agreed : they can manage money freely , it cannot be made debt .

the accounts and austerity books , together with the two defendants , said the second defendants .
why payments were not laid out in detail was asked .
it was not interested in financial care , but it was just the answer to the answer .
when a official investigation began in 2011 , a amount of $ 1@@ 20,000 was over@@ stated in the United euro .
that was , the defendants declared .
this securities account was known to the name of the second defendants , according to his statement .

the answer was long asked to answer .
then he said that he believed that this was the best for Ver@@ der .
if it happens , no one would have known this money , the prosecutor was in the room .
accused of complicity was justified , the official was justified .
this over@@ allocation was re@@ formulated .
why do harm ?
insisting on this formulation was the first defendants that he didn &apos;t agree with this formulation because it never came to harm .
but what is to do if the lawyer says :
&amp; # 160 ;
wheat , he said , said that he never had a pen@@ ny salary , and he was merely miles out of miles and dilemmas .
he had put up a 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was made much higher .
accurate documents for the early years failed to show .
they declared that they were said to be correctly judged when they had been judged correctly .
miles had been taken in the second defendants .
all of them are in place , he said that he had to go from his housing market to the Bank of the Bank , declared his statement .

while this brought the left to the left and will rule him for at least six months from the Games , Louis van G@@ a@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the violation was caused by a reckless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the fif@@ teenth minute , after the 20 years of old Sha@@ w has broken down in P@@ V S@@ V .
he was treated nine minutes on the field , and the oxygen was needed before he was brought into hospital .

it is terrible - a boy who gets 18 to Manchester United , and it is very difficult to play , and then it happens .

to be sure , David Cameron knows better ?
it is one thing that all parents learn : if your child loved your book , it will not take long until you know almost .
if you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care - the systems asked to call his favorite - the child child , the prime minister opted for The E@@ a@@ x , the 1971 @-@ 1971 environmental impact of Dr. Se@@ a@@ x .
most likely , such a relatively low public @-@ relations task , to be delegated to a heroism , has not read each other 20 times each other .

super @-@ staff confirmed that the text of Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam S@@ th was clearly threatened from exclusion from Belarus &apos;s team , but it is still hard to find it hard to do .
I would not rule out a victory .
with the ball , the ball is developing Mo@@ eums Ali as a mess - the Bo@@ w@@ w@@ ler and A@@ di@@ l , even if he is an unknown size to the test - is an option for the attack .
the related news : Adam ly@@ th is being replaced from England - the test of the test - the country &apos;s cadres , and is replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ H@@ x .
the decision to leave Adam ly@@ th , of course , is hard for me to analyze me as his chief head in Yor@@ sh@@ ire .
with his seven tests , two good attacks were under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that krill players are aimed at results .
there was no question of Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and that led to the nomination , and I have led to their own nomination .
over time , it would have extended over time , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopes to turn other purchases for the Yor@@ sh@@ ire , another opportunity is coming .
England - the dis@@ tra@@ am of Bav@@ aria - praised his stance , even if he did not get so good , and it is not surprising ; he is , above all , a team - his team .
the question of how much time a test of the test is to be made is difficult .
seven chances received seven opportunities - like Sam K@@ son before him - while N@@ ick ton was nine .
only ton could play the chance to play - and play out .
the only charge that one can rise was that England was first held in the Caribbean - first in the Caribbean - in the Caribbean - but that lost opportunity is now a lost chance .
Ale@@ x H@@ es@@ x comes , and he is an slogans that I am high .
it is a &quot; X factor &quot; - a single factor - that we have been starting to be put in place , which is what we saw in the Yor@@ sh@@ ire season when he met 2@@ 36 against us at a c@@ ac@@ ent place , which met us .
he must receive at least the same opportunities like him , but this depends on the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of making Mo@@ eums with Cook , which would get an exit - to be put into bankruptcy - the Bo@@ w@@ ler and she would receive four Qu@@ ic@@ ks , and I have nothing to do .
I don &apos;t see why you cannot beat there , and these Lin@@ k@@ sh@@ ers have already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket .
Mo@@ eums , perhaps his job for his Coun@@ ty Wor@@ sh@@ ire , is not a number of them , but there is no difference for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team for the team long played his first 38 tests before he entered the first 2001 .
he did not go immediately and not back .
Z@@ l@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari is coming in the cadres as a set of bankruptcy - the result - as a result - and in my limited dealing with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
he will learn this lot .
aside from the team , England has made a few wise supplements in the training .
the appointment of Mah@@ ay@@ ay@@ an , the Mah@@ ay@@ ay@@ sman &apos;s appointment from Sri Lanka , as advisers to the test games may be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the smar@@ test cand@@ les of the game , because he played all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul ex@@ ing@@ ing@@ ing@@ an comes to the white Ku@@ n@@ gel - the stage of the way and brings energy and a powerful use in the use .
I always felt that he has always felt that he has created the international &quot; cricket &quot; competition , as players , or a cock@@ ach , and , like Mah@@ ela , he has insights that we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh voices to fresh wind , even if the news is consistent with the past .
the team &apos;s team in D@@ HA@@ E &apos;s team in D@@ HA@@ M , Ben Ro@@ ot , will not be used in the one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one way - that he is not used - Australia , a similar break against Australia , and I do not have a problem .
some will not agree to agree , but code and team makers do not determine the timetable .
and you need to think that their players depend on their jobs .
such choices will not be easy .

experts of public Health Health Health
claims of a state @-@ funded agency - a state @-@ funded agency - are less harmful than smoking came from a 12 people , partly with links with the tobacco industry .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ Y ) joined the Lancet by criticizing the World Health Health Organization ( PTAs ) in their report on a report - to criticize cigarettes .
PTAs published the &quot; fundamental report , &quot; published last month , and describes him as a comprehensive review of evidence .
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of the data and had the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the &quot; exceptionally indigenous basis , &quot; based on PTAs &apos;s most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in B@@ M@@ Y , and asked whether the claims to be built on stone or sand .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a company &apos;s sponsors , a company called the euro &apos;s financial system , was a leader whose chief executive was previously asked by British American funds ( asked ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the credentials of the public health report on a sustainability report , they said .
one of 12 participants in the meeting declared to obtain the funds - one of cigarettes - to preserve cigarettes - but not funding the financing that he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip International .
the reasons for the choice of the body will not be delivered , but this includes several known e @-@ the @-@ known words - the result of cigarettes - for his champions , some of which also some industries - default funding in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how - how to control tobacco control .
at the meeting , tobacco is also part of tobacco .
but none of these ties or restrictions on PTAs , however , is discussed .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of PTAs that have shown that there has been no evidence so far that there is no evidence - for cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or not to serve . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
Pro@@ f F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being well @-@ being , said that the claims of B@@ M@@ Y had already responded .
he said : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
every second lifetime smokers dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of R &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; and that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
PTAs has a clear duty to public information about what evidence shows , and what , above all , has so much public confusion about tobacco relative to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion per year .
the clear evidence of current evidence - that e @-@ mail - is not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is meeting our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ ders , says a former head of Ch@@ el Ch@@ el Ch@@ el Ch@@ el &apos;s head .
Johnson said that the TV fee should be used only to make the sort of programs that will not end by the UK , which is being put in the UK .
he criticized the BBC that they publicly criticized the BBC - that the legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience - are seen in hard times against the most controversial time against the most popular of their rivals and stations like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
if you don &apos;t want to keep the fee , which I don &apos;t want to think for a medium or long term , its production should be at least on programs that do not make others or spend .
they send The bird in a first @-@ rate time because they want to achieve broad support for their future .

the video shows how to change the direction that is changing the direction in which it will be punished with K@@ ul@@ ul@@ sen .
scientists have created worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be managed by waves of waves .
the tiny volatility changes in the direction of the moment in which they are po@@ ul@@ ed with K@@ lan@@ ul@@ sen , which have heard human voices too high to be heard .
the stimulus is working through an extension of the old engines of default - the cell cells that are genetically changed to respond to the M@@ n B@@ n &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
another issue : researchers read , and write brain activity with light
F@@ und@@ worms are usually not responding to ultra @-@ liberal , but C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani found that they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ micro@@ air bubbles .
bubbles , he found , reinforce the ultra @-@ intensive waves that enter the worms .
the more ultra @-@ intensive waves of waves work on structures - the TR@@ P @-@ 4 - B@@ 4 channels , as well as to some of the worms .
the waves of waves make the opening of these I@@ ons and activ@@ ate the cells that they are allocated , such a report .
in order to create , for all of all , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , C@@ hal@@ as@@ ani , changed genetic worms so that some of their engines of the TR@@ P can carry out your budget - B@@ 4 @-@ 4 .
if he applied all the ultra @-@ changing cre@@ ons to the changed cre@@ ds , the micro@@ waves will be reinforced and transferred into the worms , where they changed the engines of power .
the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ to@@ to@@ se , a gigantic To@@ ol that allows scientists to eliminate neurons - and eliminate the lights .

eight golden rules for life in university students live in student students .
most of what I have learned can be found in eight simple rules .
the entry of student homes is too easily terrifying .
breathe .
and help others to do the same - jobs and show interest .
it distra@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out people like whom you would not speak with whom you would not speak , even if your whales were burned , and they would be stopped .
let you people .
in fact , you don &apos;t think that you don &apos;t think with a relationship with a relationship with a relationship with a relationship with a relationship .
in@@ py received a major treatment at the university .
this can be a hell for someone who seeks to recover .
try to feel when a com@@ one one is exhausted - and send a text to him .
A@@ po@@ s : you do .
a cand@@ l in my student homes had the idea that a non @-@ existent door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship is closing .
to offer , there is a good way to forge friend@@ ships .
their fellow citizens feel committed to maintaining and will end your face with a le@@ ying surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bear .
ill @-@ avoided mon@@ kes from , sugar , sugar , and fat will lead people to sleep if you are le@@ op@@ ed .
burning food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the chicken of the chickens is a theft , but is it a consolation of you ?
examine that .
the chances are good that they use themselves to service themselves , even if they enter internally .
if someone who is lacking , you are inf@@ uri@@ ating , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced , when my milk was added to milk to punish th@@ iev@@ es .
it is now in prison .
they should not make those who keep people off or from work .
it is not only about to be a decent man , but that you literally belong to the people who sit in the glass house .
a girl on my fl@@ ur asked their neighbors whether they account for printing B@@ ass B@@ ass , because it was three clock , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more music .
after all , when they listened to 5 clock , they allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they allowed their own music to break their door and reject their three @-@ time scrutiny .
would it not be romantic if your future marriage happens to happen to the same student ?
of course , the heart of its own ways - but if a hot complicity is definitely not your future adul@@ tery , you try to speak at least one little reason .
at the exciting moment you notice that someone can always be the key in his non @-@ closed Z@@ di@@ bs , the border between an ultra @-@ ultra and M@@ ob@@ er seems to be one .
a good empire is a good thing , but it takes place only until he gets the B@@ ang .
don &apos;t give you a valuable and soft lesson about security - but you never always failed to see a one &apos;s Z@@ n@@ a and Sh@@ am@@ po@@ o .
you close their door to your door , and you put their key to water , which you will then make up in the cold - but you no longer find their ownership of ownership .

the entrepreneurs of Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ers know how fast @-@ cost housing can be created : it is built in a project for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ d@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution does you offer ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner : mass institution@@ alization in , or on all , has no sustainability .
for the people remain much part of here .
in the face of refugees , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
a perfect , three @-@ tier rice solution is a solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : a rice that takes least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put up people in housing .
each of the six houses that are now built in the pilot project consists of three units of asylum for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two sleep room , a bad room , a kit@@ che , and a new area .
it can be that many refugees will be back to peace , I return .
then the houses can easily be built after the needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : the price of living per house amounts to 18@@ 4 euros without basic land .
this is manageable .
six months took place .
this is appropriate .
have construction rules complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : building legally , I have learned my project correctly .
it is particularly complicated that it is always the threat of the dam , and the looming bursting order .
gra@@ us@@ g .
it is still set to create those who create a rice of three homes .
there is no place only in cities .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the people respond to the rice of the budget - that is how to respond ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : what I have accused me of creating luxury goods for asylum seekers .
what is definitely wrong .
but do you not exacerbate competition for affordable homes ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : we had had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but it built luxury homes that hardly can afford .
my project has my message , and ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but as well as the single mother or lower earners .
I show how good and well can build well .
this is why it is about .

the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
still , it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum mandate , of course , can make it .
people &apos;s security and security remain .
it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals ; the minister said .
people need to know that we don &apos;t accept that we don &apos;t accept migration , nor do the Au@@ str@@ o @-@ Au@@ str@@ o @-@ Au@@ str@@ ic border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia .
the American government had previously said that Slovenia , including Slovenia , wants to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also create cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
at this point , as V@@ es@@ na &apos;s interior minister , V@@ es@@ na &apos;s Interior Minister L@@ ai@@ ei was not .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is absolutely unacceptable ; Slovenia would instead intensify the surveillance of the border - particularly Hungary - .
the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is heavily controlled by the country &apos;s external borders .
as the minister emphasized , you don &apos;t want to dismiss its borders for refugees .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
the American police could use them in the near corn fields .

it was predominantly Syrians and Afghans , including many women and children .
bailout services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees said , Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ ic said .
moreover , b@@ uses from Pre@@ ma@@ m would be put out of his ma@@ ma@@ ma@@ or@@ cally - the Tibetan border , which has brought migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , told Croatia , and Serbian media .
but the government in Belgrade denied that it is that it is wise to go down certain routine : neither can we still want to do this ; it was .
according to media reports , a first B@@ us , with roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border Si@@ si@@ d , would have arrived over the day .
Austria , Slovenia , and Austria
the inmates were the entire night on the end of the roughly 500 kilometers away from Serbia through Serbia .
&amp; # 160 ; We have heard that Hungary , so the police told us that we should drive it .
they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia , and Austria .
for this , indeed , the already predicted shift of the Balkans - for the Balkans - could be put aside by Turkey - the way that Greece - to be put on the way - in the future of the bankruptcy of the Balkans .
Croatia : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
Croatia &apos;s Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared for adequate plans for potential refugees in the case of a strong stream of refugees .
he did not , he did not , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ bank - the Schengen Schengen - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
consider strict controls to qualify for membership in the space area .
Slovenia is part of this in 2007 , which the EU has been asking for the EU - since then - has been a good reminder of what affects the standard of border controls .
on the part of the Serb side , there remains about 300 refugees .
according to media reports , they would have spent the past night on the border of horror that leads to R@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border lines remain completely shut down .
whether remaining refugees now want to continue to travel is unclear .
it would not now pay for very high refugee figures .
they cannot say whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
migrants -
but private private professionals have already begun to distribute refugees to the refugees , with an alternative routine by Croatia .
the border between Serbia and Croatia , however , is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still non @-@ existent fields after the end of Croatia &apos;s war war .
on the last day , the police police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ ers was sent in the border with the border .
stock exchanges -
with the exploited information , insiders should have been made business in financial markets .

F@@ ed@@ ed@@ s
F@@ ed@@ t reported disappointing results for the last quarter , and the favorite giant - the giant giant reduced his earnings on an entire year because of the weaker demand for Fra@@ c services and higher costs in his service service .
the firm also said that it plans to hire roughly 5@@ 5,000 workers for the vacations .
earlier this year , F@@ ed@@ ed@@ s announced that companies want to hire 50,000 Sa@@ is@@ on@@ workers for the vacation season .
the stock market fell more than 2.5 % in Pre@@ pre@@ ture , which is 45 @-@ 45 minutes before opening up .
F@@ ed@@ o cor@@ p@@ p@@ ings said to earn a profit between $ 1@@ 40 $ 40 and 1@@ $ 0.@@ 90 in the next year , which ends next May , 20 cents less than in previous prediction .
analysts expected $ 1@@ 84 to $ 0.@@ 84 .
the lower prospect comes despite the lower price increases , average average 4.@@ 9 % , and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher spreads for severe and large packages that will be imposed on November .
the company said that , however , the result is that the result of the result , owing to the cost reduction , higher revenues , and growth in online growth - will increase its trade .
chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield solid returns if you consider weaker economic conditions , particularly in terms of economic and global trade .
the plans for vacation lines - a day later - were announced as the rivals of U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 @-@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended August 31 , F@@ 6@@ 92 million more than $ 6@@ 92 million than last year .
the result of the stock market amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ 42 , just behind the 2.@@ 44 per year that the 12 Investment Research Research predicted predicted .
sales rose by 5 % to 1@@ 2.3 billion .
six asked analysts expected $ 1@@ 2.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , in the last few years , a decline in international capital @-@ policy failures - which brought the re@@ alignment of its unity - has been able to stagnate .
but the boom in online default - Sh@@ Sh@@ ine has increased the results in F@@ ed@@ ny and increased .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 % , but the operational result was essentially flat for greater costs and self @-@ insurance .
the Ex@@ Ex@@ Le@@ --@@ entity recorded higher revenues , owing to higher prices , while the result of higher labor costs declined .

the card is a reminder that the Fed is the Fed - the head of President Jan@@ et Y@@ et , and her colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximizing US employment and prices .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed has recognized that there is a unwritten mandate : financial stability .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , which itself is worrying itself about the financial market itself .
about half of economists who were recently asked by Bloomberg have predicted this week .
but financial markets expect the Fed to wait with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the phrase , because it is that strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far removed .
the Dow sent 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 85 points or 5@@ 9.@@ 1.4 % at 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed was triggered by the Fed - the Fed &apos;s phrase - said this week , John London , the chief economist at Moody &amp; # ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point ; he said .
if it does , it would have to go very far in order to calm financial markets , lest they panic .
other experts argued that it would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
even a month ago , the Fed seemed to be a good way to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ mer had said in the spring and early summer that , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would require more economic progress , they expected to increase .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the idea that the Fed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , although inflation was constantly falling under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said that the Fed , for the main reason , said that the main reason is the temporary impact of lower oil prices .
the economy .
but financial markets around the world ended last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow carbon average fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that slowing China &apos;s economy would reduce global growth .
the market has recovered this month , with the Dow now almost 10 % below May .
for the Fed , the Fed will affect the complex calculations that it should raise interest rates .
now he says that they will wait for at least a month to manage the impact better .
the health of the global economy is none of the Fed &apos;s main concern , so it should not be involved in decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of then then Ben Bernanke &apos;s Ben Bernanke in 2013 is that the Fed could leave its monetary expansion .
their decision @-@ making is a &quot; more art &quot; than science .
L@@ lit@@ er , a member of the Federal Reserve Committee on an interest rate hike , cited decisions cited in 1998 / 1999 .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to cut its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings ; despite a limited impact on growth in the US , he said that he said .
a year later , the Fed was reversed - the Fed &apos;s officials reversed these cuts .
the Fed should set the aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market crash in 2008 , said Adam Po@@ sen , a former member of the Committee on interest @-@ rate spreads in England .
the recent turmoil is not near this level , he said .
to be sure , you certainly don &apos;t want to get the situation in which they fear a hike in markets , because markets said ; po@@ po@@ sen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be expected .

there are exceptions for all the new exceptions for all of the S@@ olo@@ th@@ th@@ e .

the ro@@ cks must become a solar facility .
before that , the panel had yet to put a request for a legal law . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
for the exception of the exception , it was permission for permission for a special design .
so what is to be built , which is not being built - is being built and built .
the backdrop of planning is the proposed use of solar panels : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
on the &quot; liberation &quot; of liberation , it was in turn the bias that is supposed to be under ten reasons - unlike in the construction plan - to be below ten degrees .

however , there is no recurring project in the project .
at the center of the center , a community project is a community of community and S@@ V @-@ V .
at the cost , there are roughly 2.3 million euros .

if plans are implemented , all of the 50 staff would be preoccupied with the hospital &apos;s hospital .

in Ver@@ e@@ r , the twenty @-@ 20 &quot; s were being put out of the way that killed young young@@ sters and have thrown their bo@@ che into a channel in rock @-@ rock directions .
a Satur@@ day since Satur@@ day has been missing 16 @-@ day - the Rhin@@ eland of the Rhin@@ eland - Le@@ am@@ z has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the wife of the young woman was found to be found at a service of service in the emperor , as prosecutors and police were shared .
as a suspect , he is also considered a service of 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 &quot; s , as well as he was , which is , indeed , that led to charges of dec@@ ency .
the 16 @-@ 16 @-@ day bankruptcy was reported tomorrow , after being reported on the eve of a autumn &apos;s visit to rock , no matter how home came home .
in search for the young woman , the profession initially met at the personal counterpart of the victim .
in the words of Fre@@ m@@ - and acquain@@ ting of the missing , there was finally a re@@ thinking against the G @-@ 20 &quot; s .
the alleged perpetrators then led the police to a channel in rock @-@ rock areas .
the authorities according to the authorities , according to the police , gave up the 16 to the 16 @-@ 16 @-@ year @-@ to @-@ have been killed and put into the channel .
the G @-@ 20 &quot; s - as well - should be carried out on the top of the port of law , which speci@@ ters him at the burden .

refugees need shelter : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more refugees also seek to be affordable .
pressure on housing prices is growing .
social construction faces a challenge .
the distributional struggles on the German housing market have long started .
with the coming refugees and workers from the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ stretched in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable homes .
to cover demand for affordable homes every year , 400,000 new units would have to be built .
this outcome comes to a study in the mandate of the debacle . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
compared to this year , Germany &apos;s 2@@ 60,000 units will deal with this year .
they lack 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their house , as asylum seekers live in a first @-@ time future .
many then run on housing markets , and they are entering a long line of homes .
according to the federal office , however , the last year was less than half of all asylum seekers .
but the negative development of housing market is not only the rising refugee .
the study also makes significant failures in housing policies in recent years .
Germany was a housing deficit that will become greater by year .
currently , in the areas already around 7@@ 0,000 units of housing , he has complained about Mat@@ thi@@ as &apos;s study , the author of the study .
many involved in large cities , therefore , have brought back to the G @-@ 8 .
young adults remained un@@ voluntary because of the housing market in the housing market voluntarily .
in large cities , the number of square meters per capita has fallen back in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance proposes &quot; social construction &quot; .
in the process , new incentives should boost social construction .
so , for example , the land could be reduced and exposed to the basic tax on @-@ sponsored homes .
moreover , according to an alliance , attractive fiscal opportunities are needed .
the subsidy program for refugee holders of the State Bank is already good in cities and communities .
a good week after the launch of the 18@@ 4 million euro was already launched with roughly half of the € 300 million euro .
now the project could be expanded .
refugees have to be free : Croatia and Slovenia have a free deal : Croatia and Slovenia .
after Hungary , there is virtually no longer , because more refugees are voting for Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ b claims to grant the home trip to Slovenia without hurdles to the north .
but the route is dangerous .
with neighboring Croatia , Slovenia wants to establish a cor@@ rid@@ ors of refugees .
&amp; # ; &amp; # 160 ; I have spoken with the deputy interior minister , and if we are necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ri@@ dor .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen &quot; Schengen &quot; zone .
the EU - the country that Croatia is not yet Schengen - is not the Schengen country .
according to the dismantling of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken after Croatia to reach out to Western Europe .
500 people are about the border with To@@ wers , reports of the American television station R@@ L .
Hungary had its limits on refugees .
new legislation that joined the same day is virtually redundant in Hungary .
Croatia wants to happen .
the American prime minister , at Mil@@ vi@@ vi@@ c , declared : you can travel , and we are preparing for this possibility . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
these people are women , children , and men who live and do something .
but people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the police police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU - its neighboring country .
most media reports suggest that Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan report .
they came in both the B@@ us B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ en in the Serbian border Si@@ si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to enter the green border with Croatia .
at the heart of the Serbian border , the refugees do not run out of borders .
there are other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
e@@ min@@ ations should now be a safe passage .
after all , after closing the border , there are little more refugees .
the police ran 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before Mon@@ day , 9@@ 80 were 9@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws , through the new laws , and the damage to the border is a criminal offense .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings have been launched in the southern border city of S@@ ap@@ ons .
the convictions threaten prison for five years , and the country &apos;s departure from the country .
according to the immigration authority , it has taken back on the border in the border . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
among producers , 13 families are with small children and two older people .
tomorrow , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
but virtually no one has a chance to obtain asylum in Hungary .
according to this view , Serbia is a secure third country . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
asylum seekers should be closed to the top .

R@@ z@@ ke has started to clean up workers .
they accumulated waste , which had left tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks .
Sper@@ it@@ it@@ ers were reduced , and one of the ro@@ ds in the border was built .
no one wanted to speak .
Austria , after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , is only few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but , by 20,000 migrants , there was still a country in the country .
in Sal@@ z@@ burg , around 1@@ 400 people wait for Germany .
moving from Germany to Germany was stopped at the day of German authorities .
smaller groups of refugees hit regularly smaller groups of refugees .

that Viktor Or@@ b@@ ers now send thousands of us to holy politics is a logical result of holy politics :
instead of helping the camp on R@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly revealed the attitudes of the Hungarian government to Nazism in Nazism .
these policies are not just those who are now facing the border with chaotic conditions .
the cur@@ ated will also have to find that the &quot; promised land , &quot; which was invited and welcomed welcome , is nothing another refugee camp .
it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter to establish human @-@ rights conditions for protection .
and it will be greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .

overall , there is a need for 8@@ 5,000 .

the trip from refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible .
but there is now the appropriate border controls .
special deductions to Germany , for now , will be no longer .
but the protective systems would be brought to Germany to be settled .
by other EU member states , P@@ inger called for even more greater solidarity in the refugee issue .
that Austria is now on its limits to controls on its borders is a logical consequence of a logical consequence of the Germans &quot; actions .

the P@@ ver@@ zer ancestors of a place came from a place whose residents are called .
this quality , too , combines with the billionaire , the US will want to become the country &apos;s president .
Donald Rumsfeld ( 69 ) is always good .
whether he is xenophobic , journalists , or the knowledge cycle in international crisis politics - for the US president - the US presidency has shifted to the campaign .
and it is doing well .
this will also be registered in an old city city , where the grand@@ parents &quot; grand@@ parents come from tens of millions .
New York with the F@@ ay@@ s@@ ur is a long term in the Win@@ f in the Win@@ f .
some of the 1@@ 200 residents - the country &apos;s residents - is about to be put on his place .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ am@@ z , Donald P@@ ing@@ z , in the campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ one W@@ gh@@ el W@@ gh@@ el turned a movie more than a film .
and what will villagers think about his goal of becoming the world &apos;s most powerful man ?
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; I believe that this is somehow exciting , but is not so deeply impressed in its all@@ ent way .
the native urban prosecutor has an am@@ am@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ documentary film on the place and his famous sp@@ ose , along with those who matter , alongside K@@ et@@ ch@@ z .

so what is coming from the village .
the spin &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grand@@ father turned out and opened a case for gold .
the seeds of the real estate concept were first in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tra@@ k : their desire to return to home was failed to return to the solar state that was at the time .
he did not be admitted , because he was once dismissed without the Institute &apos;s director , Director of the Institute for History and , and Paul Paul , the film .
spin was the grandchildren of one &quot; illegal and illegal . &quot; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
this contrasts with the contrast to the descendants of the descendants .
the US has repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants and called for a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .

the benefits of loss of weight for easily over@@ stretched people with 2 @-@ 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say whether easily over@@ stretched people with diabetes live longer after the weight of the weight of surgical surgery than those who are not being able to preserve surgery .
weight -
they reduce hunger and limit physical capacity to absorb food .
B@@ M@@ I , a degree of size , is as normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I are regarded as ob@@ ese .
they can calculate your B@@ M@@ I : 1,@@ 1,@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ q@@ q@@ v .
the average B@@ M@@ I , under which operation , fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of this year .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I remained stuck in the B@@ M@@ I - the M@@ I - that was not the same thing that surgical surgery received around 29 .
among those subjected to surgical surgery , 36 % of diabetes triggered the disease altogether and partly at 28 % .
in medical re@@ - @-@ treated group , diabetes , in comparison , triggered only one % , partly at only about two % .
researchers also monitoring the patient - the blood @-@ blood mirror mirror of the global A@@ mo@@ c in A@@ 1@@ A@@ c , which reflects blood values over time .
Ar@@ mo@@ c in A@@ 1@@ c is at best below 7 % , researchers write .
after the operation , the average average global at 1@@ 9 % fell from around 9 % to around 6 % .
medical therapy , however , remained around 8 % .
the research team also compared average results to two types of ch@@ on .
in the Swedish study , it was found in an A@@ di@@ tas C@@ di@@ tas - Operation surgery - about 29 % less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought more conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the ch@@ oc@@ gy of the bank - the Tibetan patient - Blackstone said that it is reassuring for individuals with a B@@ M@@ I who are interested in trial .
this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower B@@ M@@ I is lower .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously ; they said .
I think that once they have collected genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult .

it is impossible ; It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe ; he said he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he emphasized that it is only a temporary solution .
ultimately , we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; use of violence never solved these problems ; it added .
the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and led George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 th , and turned out that the violent response of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
after September 11 , I told me in a letter to President Bush , and I said him , the way to resolve this problem is non @-@ violence .
as I know , I know his motives , but he used violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences ; the Dalai Lama said .
fourth , the fourth rise of infection by children in recent years by children over the past 4 years has gone 4 years from children over the past 4 years .
bank @-@ control centers in the US report almost 400 infections - as well - increasing the number of children among twelve years , which can swallow a strong coal cell phone .
&amp; # 160 ; children are increasingly common to these products , and , unfortunately , a percentage of them go in emergency space ;
he said that some children of disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ants are deliberately drowning , while some do do some to press their friends or because of a mu@@ test for social media .
videos in YouTube show how youth disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ant only because of a cheap experience .
young youth are supposedly disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ant with coal @-@ consuming water .
younger children can be derived from attractive disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ants .
&amp; # 160 ; A child does not think that it is bad for .
many of the more attractive ( in hand - the in@@ fec@@ t@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ying .
there are disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ants with earthquake , wine , and Orange , which are very appealing for children .
infectious infections contain somewhere between 45 and 95 % alcohol .
in particular , a few children can lead to alcohol poisoned .
&quot; It is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , director of the medical director of the Gi@@ ot@@ ot@@ o Center in the hospital of the University of Kansas , told the station in Fox City .
so you would not be fooled , but you would be fooled , but that you would be fooled , but humans can be put in hand - the official disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ant to reach children , and when children come up , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ah Russell , a six @-@ year girl that recently adopted four @-@ year @-@ ago , after the four @-@ year earthquake , was taken into emergency treatment .

my child could have been lethal for my child .
Lopez Obrador has recommended parents and teachers to use coal @-@ free products or infectious drugs , and out@@ source infectious drugs outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol poisoned , some disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in the on@@ t@@ t@@ ations of women in the aftermath of de@@ fec@@ t@@ ants that have a toxic toxic , non @-@ de@@ ari@@ zed base .
public health officials suspect that the product of methane was contained , a lethal solution , rather than ethanol coal , which was treated as an effectiveness .
the curriculum is highly aller@@ gic against de@@ fec@@ t@@ ant and expelled them from their room .
the police regarded the plan &apos;s plan as a result . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160

later today , exempt from a late legal intervention , I will watch a man to death .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation for the first time was the best friend in January , and , although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day , I began to fear me .
so why should I do ?
I agreed because I thought that it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .

Richard G@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
I don &apos;t tell me what I have , and I would not do , even if he would do .
I have told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .

his actions after the assassination of Bar@@ ry Herman Van would make him guilty , indeed , to be an beneficiaries .

and from this perspective , I will die .
I cannot claim to be truly objec@@ tively .

in 2015 , the movement has seen the compensation that is particularly well sold .
cars from the compensation class are particularly needed : roughly 2@@ 8.@@ 1 % of new branches of power , according to the National Office of State ( K@@ BA ) alone in August alone .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( publication of September 27 ) .
there are many new compensation models between all the no@@ ur@@ istic vehicles and new high @-@ class and luxury cars this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ achers for the German highway is the way that traders will stand in the autumn of traders .

V@@ V@@ V@@ A J@@ A Berlin - A cell square : five square square kilometers
the federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ judicial detainee , the judicial code of justice , which was a small cell over months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , detainees have been entitled to financial compensation when they are too small cells .
this has decided that the federal Constitutional Court decided to be decided in a ro@@ ed@@ day .
indeed , the judges can hope to get money even if they were jailed only a few days ( 1 / 14 ) .
after that , the man who has now come back to his request was a larger cell .
he failed because of unfettered liability for the country of Berlin .
but the constitutional judge pointed back the verdict of the Kam@@ el Court of Berlin , and rejected the new test .
they see the human dignity of the man .
Kam@@ el &apos;s court now decides to determine compensation of compensation .
even if legal grounds for a few days of compensation for compensation were decisive , it was said that there was only a few days of compensation .
otherwise , there would be a decline in the legal protection of personality .
the Kam@@ el Court must now resolve the magnitude of money .
the constitutional judge has often strengthened the rights of criminal crimes .
so they spoke only in April after April because he was imprisoned in a cell .
indeed , in fact , a choice of a cell , according to human beings , is , according to it , a cell , according to a separate to@@ te .
Kar@@ l@@ s@@ s also confirmed , moreover , that the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had presented a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009 in November 2009 in November 2009 , had agreed .

Berlin prisons have had headlines in recent weeks because of the headlines .

Angela Merkel and refugee policies are : we create this ; we create this .
immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German economy is determined to embrace them .
what comes to Germany ?
roughly 800 asylum seekers are coming to Germany this year after Germany , according to Deputy Chancellor Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( Social Democrats ) , is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( Christian Democrats ) demonstrated the unusual challenge : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
what Germany faces is the following vision .
what is needed after different forecasts between $ 3@@ 50,000 ( estimate of the federal Ministry ) and $ 0@@ 0@@ ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) - for the next five years - will be for the next five years .
this is almost twice as far as it is built ( 25@@ 0@@ 7,000 ) .
but , above all , the lack of housing is especially affordable : a year from 60@@ 0,000 to 800,000 social homes from a low @-@ cost peg , and these particularly favorable homes will compete for refugees .
federal Minister K@@ a H@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double , now $ 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
much of this is the point of the P@@ est@@ el Institute - The Institute - 80 @-@ year social homes would have to emerge , and it would have to invest in a $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
in agreement , scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the Institute &apos;s estimates for labor @-@ market and professional research , the long term is that the long run in Germany can be working .
but the refugees in Germany would not be systematically needed to help them in helping them to help them , Walter Walter , the project of project integration , and education in the Berlin Foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial to whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , with the value of the p@@ ep@@ tive society , but also the sense of immigrants &quot; self @-@ value , says Di@@ et@@ rich throne .
in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political turnaround : the ban on refugees to recognize work .
while it used a ban on asylum seekers for too five years , the ban on this month was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the rule of asylum , asylum asylum seekers .
in society , too , because of expert expertise , the belief that refugees should be allowed to allow refugees to gain faster access to the labor market .
a big obstacle to the labor market access is missing .
so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and basic language .
research also shows that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts .
building networks , therefore , is the view of the throne for labor integration .
to convince the family , however , the benefits of K@@ ita are distributed in different languages .
if the need for refugees to increase the number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more professional schools .
in countries , students are prepared to be prepared for teaching in the world .
but they are not always educated teachers and teachers , but as well as Berlin , and teachers who have only a broad language in English .
there is no shortage , says that the Berlin administration says .
the Germans are estimated to study about 20 % of the refugees in Germany .
in principle , no federal country was barred from asylum seekers or study - the only exception has been Berlin - the only exception to Berlin , the interior minister Frank Frank ( CDU ) , but has abandoned his stance .
senior refugees could be relieved by access to high school .
for refugees with a dis@@ location or tolerance , no benefits after asylum @-@ seekers , no longer receive merit when they begin to study study .
the latter don &apos;t get a bear , because they do not fall under the circle of eligible people .
patient refugees have had lived in Germany for four years to have been lived in B@@ oc@@ g B@@ oc@@ g - on January 1 , 2016 , on January 1 , 2016 .
but this financing gap must also be shut down , demanding l@@ phe@@ ws , Berlin &apos;s State secretary for science , and the German student works .
students should immediately get bear .
Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
the state should give Islam the same rights to the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state - for the country - churches - for a new state - a new state - for the new religions - will continue to develop .
it would also be important to create an Islamic welfare state that is professional for newcomers .
the right includes duties .
indeed , Islam &apos;s representative must agree on a clear partner and be willing to cooperate with many areas in many areas .
this is also a willingness to engage in religious fundamentalism .
the chairman of the Muslim Council &apos;s chairman , A@@ im@@ z@@ z@@ k Ma@@ z@@ k , expressed the concern that religious conflicts might bear in Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right .
he proposed to put the Basic Law on Arab states .
integration will still be much more than today &apos;s society .
this will need to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has a anti @-@ discriminatory anti @-@ discriminatory approach for a few decade .
but it is very slowly to learn how the N@@ S@@ U was systematically ignored , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
Germany is generally able to supply the expected refugees to provide medical refugees , according to President Frank ultra @-@ rich .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
but extra money must flow .
in order to avoid bottlenecks , it calls for a g@@ om@@ ery to wipe out all of the no@@ des in the ro@@ ps of health care .
benefits could later be expected with federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly dubious to see so many people with the limited performance of the performance of asylum @-@ seekers that see asylum @-@ seekers .
otherwise , doctors , above all , create language barriers .
already , so far , the fall of the world &apos;s health @-@ care science , the@@ ology , will make migrants worse off their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics in clinics that would have to be adopted in D@@ ol@@ es .
to help many refugees , however , would have more general medical appeal to the emergency .
and with another diagnostic look .
for example , there were far more volatile disabilities , and the youth of the young are in order to be put in place - the White Enlightenment .
but , with some other cases of disease , German doctors would be clear from their education .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the Syrians had a advanced education system , many refugees are even doctors .
to practice them , however , they would have to demonstrate their skills and may be shown again .
at least half of the German refugees ( B@@ P@@ C ) , at least half of the German refugees ( B@@ P@@ C ) , is sick : most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
most vulnerable are most vulnerable , which explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ K .
a recent study published in Munich shows that every fifth Syrian chief of law is traumatized in Germany .
those who have a post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , including so so so @-@ called F@@ h@@ backs , are suffering , fraud , heart heart , and death .
other symptoms are sleep - and concentration disorders , strong terror , and emotional thaw .
to prevent the symptoms from preventing early treatment , Mun@@ z said that early treatment was necessary .
so far , only four % of the ill @-@ ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
true , ill @-@ ill asylum seekers in social @-@ welfare seekers can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , but it takes place for several months .
moreover , social @-@ welfare workers , or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this is often mis@@ stated , Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe &apos;s parliamentary speech keeps Mugabe &apos;s speech in parliament in parliament .
Mugabe , Africa &apos;s most old leaders , fell from a good step from a po@@ dium .
he remained un@@ touched , but the video of the media quickly spread to the socialist media .
the parliament &apos;s opening was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators , that they have received anonymous death threats and warned that they were warned of Mugabe &apos;s phrase with the buck .
last month , she had spent him and was interrupted during his speech in parliament - that is the speech he repeated .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; The news comes from a number that is not shown , but she has mentioned the title of death . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160

on the arsenal - the captain , the captain , says that the game against the captain , against the dyn@@ Ar@@ sh@@ a , is the game against the wounded Wil@@ sh@@ a .
few were emphasized to Wil@@ sh@@ sh@@ ers that it was only September , and unless his rehabilitation plan exists , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that , surely , the next four games will miss the next four games for England , and , given his history , his participation in the next summer is uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that the last season had ended after a separate K@@ al@@ so@@ ar season , and then returned to its old momentum during the season .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
it is a bones not well .
this is not a larger matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not associated with his c@@ ams or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from purely medical view , but , like few , there is the ultimate danger of further injury , whenever a player tried to return to the season in the midst of the season .
there is also an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ d L@@ t@@ d &apos;s 23 different diseases has been different from Wil@@ sh@@ t since his six years ago .
he also played in just 65 in 15@@ 7 , as they have in the last five games .
the broader picture for arsenal is that they have been in six times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced most vulnerability .
few people accept the potential of a vicious circle , but the arsenal believes that improvement in the last season will continue .
&amp; # ; Som@@ e , if you get back from injury , you have a vulnerable period of time , a time in which you must win your body and win combat power ; few said .
it is young enough to overcome this .
I hope that his body stabilized , I am confident that he will do it and make a career by the sort he deserves .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor B@@ é@@ í@@ n and A@@ ar@@ on , A@@ ar@@ on Croatia , does not mean that Ma@@ é@@ li@@ y De@@ y and Ar@@ as@@ a is likely to launch .
few , too , can also start with Ki@@ a , and , instead , , rather than to start , Mon@@ o Mon@@ o and P@@ o Wal@@ Wal@@ t .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; I try to balance the balance and the players who need it to be a small blueprint for the rise .
although the arsenal is clear , while the group is clear that the group , the st@@ adi@@ r of the n@@ adi@@ r - the C@@ adi@@ on in Z@@ adi@@ b belongs to the playing field with the biggest effect in Europe .
the dyn@@ Games is not defeated after 41 games , after the last season was launched . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the St@@ adi@@ on was shaken by an earthquake on the day by a earthquake , and was measured by the rule of law .
this year was this 10 @-@ year .
it is immense .
it has never vanished .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not .
the F@@ end@@ s@@ s@@ est : the Com@@ qui@@ s@@ est : how serious lessons about human @-@ welfare lessons tell us with serious lessons about human affairs .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of men at the age of 20 to 45 , and remains three times more frequently than women in women .
friendship is the heart of the fight to meet this challenge .
for those who are not depressive , a circle of healthy healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , you must have friends to work for friendship .
in the era of social media @-@ led communications , with its focus on substance , the in@@ predictability of the answer is often more important than significant contact .
our digital life has the need to appear strong , living and successful , even if the reality dominates isolation .
this superficial success dominates what psychologists call the exact values ; money , social status , all at the expense of basic values - our internal yearning for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and , like a video game , the invent@@ ors , and billionaire recently declared , money cannot buy luck .
the beauty of it was that this focus was put on its head .
each character was defined not by its work , but by its personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
men who confront us often feel unable to speak with friends .
the old return of speech , I am right , has a huge effect , such as a sense that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems .
it is one of the point that I make sense when I try to offer more long @-@ term mechanisms .
it is clearly presented to the small moments of shortcomings .
so much objective long @-@ term maver@@ ick - that status over the phone may help people look at the moment of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and if you don &apos;t attend the deadline for this weekend , Central Committee with the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends with a D@@ rin@@ k in Central Per@@ k , why you don &apos;t take your friends with a d@@ rin@@ k in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone else alone , you pay a smile and say you .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will end up to the beginning of the outset - all of the 2@@ 36 episodes - for all of the long @-@ term episodes .

in the early time at the top of the top , a larger role was replaced by the home car industry - and is now re@@ discovered as kidney .
Rein@@ re@@ t calls some examples : at the top of the mo@@ ck , at the same time as pockets and regional .
at all , the so @-@ called so @-@ called V@@ in@@ s - a fashion that rejects the past in the past - is a growing constraint .
those in textiles in the textile industry in Germany is no longer market .
they already make up half of all orders .
Mo@@ it@@ it@@ it@@ ly P@@ ame is together with nine other companies in the industry of P@@ at top and nitrogen .
only they must carry out the protected Lab@@ el .
over the past 15 years , roughly 80 % of the approach was broken .
private trading and large trading are almost no longer .
our products hardly reach out to customers .
mass transfers nowadays are much cheaper in Asian space , and almost exclusively expelled .
exports are also weakening , now Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
Rein@@ v@@ t supplemented : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
as a colleague , U@@ Schmidt famously teaches the West &apos;s snow@@ se of the West &apos;s high @-@ school school - a school of applied art - and speci@@ alized on nitrogen and leaders .
competition from Asian competition must be found to be high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that needs time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh ideas of debriefing and those who need to think in particular economically ; say , Schmidt says .
this is why a existing design often varies easily to keep a consumer .
a few years ago , textile textile , K@@ K@@ K@@ ati , was the historic snow@@ ball .
in the process , the machine of small jobs is ticking .
the P@@ yp@@ a gold sentence in the Bi@@ or@@ a H@@ or@@ a H@@ ok@@ b@@ a H@@ b@@ oc@@ a - put himself away - was to inspire : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
now they used the snow@@ ball for their smuggling .
in a costly process , it takes the pattern in silver .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
it also provides the US , after Australia , and after Finland - especially in customers whose ancestors want to live in a clever and environment .
thus , I see my smuggling as a modern ambassador of P@@ at top .
Dis@@ ney plans &quot; new &quot;
it is not supposed to be , but Dis@@ ney does not dare to refer to a new film of his classic classic phrase .
this is according to &quot; En@@ ter@@ ek@@ ly We@@ ek@@ ly , &quot; but not a new re @-@ fil@@ ting but a sort of continuation that plays the first film with the magi@@ cal child .

who is still unclear for more than 50 years after Ju@@ ad Andre@@ &apos;s is unclear .
but the director is already clear : R@@ P , least with the head of the Woods . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
Xi is pressing for the world to open the economy to the world
the economy must open itself more broadly to promote growth , President Xi Jinping said a group of a group charged with reforming reform .
encouraging new reforms and pushing forward new momentum and provide new place for economic growth , Xi said .
after the statute , a negative list is designed to identify the sectors and companies that don &apos;t matter for investment .
the system will continue to be tested and improved through testing programs .
the initiative is important , because it gives the market a greater role in allocation of resources , provides a right @-@ wing business environment and designed open the market .
the government will also ease controls on corporate companies and ensure that companies decide how they do business .
the statement also said that China will allow new models to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
opening other areas to state @-@ controlled sectors opened other areas to private investment .

the lawyers &quot; right to guarantee their operations , and to use professional judges and prosecutors , was also held at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Liu , and Z@@ hang G@@ a@@ es , share as reported in a meeting published after the meeting .
the EU wants to double the source of mercury .
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large fish and make consumers a much higher dose of nerve .
large @-@ scale fish , however , are so heavily burdened with mercury that they cannot be sold on the basis of the 50 % basis .
after doubling limits , there would be only 1@@ 4.5 % .
in exchange for this easing , the EU wants to exacerbate the limits of limits on other hundreds of millions of millions of millions of millions of mercury per ton of mercury .
Fo@@ od@@ od@@ ine , however , called this . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
it is a small way to cut down .
mercury is a highly toxic focus on the food chain above all .
the federal government is therefore warning that , already , small amounts can cause low numbers of the nervous system . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the federal Ministry of State , on its peak , explains the level of its peak , but that a health toll on the general population is not expected to be expected .
mercury , above all , gets into the environment .
last year , wide warnings about mercury in fish already included the common health risks in the EU - a warning system R@@ AS@@ F@@ F .
