8 years show that Donald Tusk is taken seriously .
some tried to brand him as a store @-@ up .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but , no matter how some Republicans try to draw from the top contributors to the top polls , it has not worked .
ten of the last ten national polls , published in double @-@ digit , and some start seriously , seriously about what it means for the chances of the &quot; home home . &quot;
it is , of course , too early in the election .
no one argues that the Republican nomination is likely to win .
experts stress that in 2011 , in 2011 , California &apos;s leadership led to the rise of a rising president , none of which won only a state in the process process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight for a popular election .
but outsiders like equal Bush &apos;s regular PA@@ C and the conservative economic club for Growth now see the hand of growth and begin to throw their dollar flowing to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that indicate that property is not just a temporary phase :
the ratings ratings have become 180 degrees .
soon before Donald Mil@@ v announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ x@@ ony University was that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate in real estate .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % were 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans now face a positive view of Donald Tusk .
three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .

two @-@ thirds of the G@@ G@@ P , the G@@ G@@ P , would be happy with scandal as candidates .
in a run @-@ up @-@ B@@ O@@ C last week , 67 % of the Republicans said that they would be a bond for them or a return ; if it would be nominated , it would be nominated .
only two 10 years ago , they would be defeated ; if he were the candidate .
only ID@@ Car@@ son provides the same enthusiasm as an indicator ( 43 % said that it would be the same ) ; a combination of 40 % , which is the same to say . )
the next enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co is only 21 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of the Republican electorate voted that they would be defeated ; if anything , it would be the party &apos;s favorite party , the candidate would be the candidate .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t sound than problem .
the same number is true of the country &apos;s first national @-@ democratic state , the state , where the same 52 % of the Republicans think that he is a leader who is a central player , according to Qu@@ in@@ ess@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % said that he was not the personality to proceed effectively , and almost six of 10 @-@ year @-@ to @-@ day say that his temper@@ ament was not based on the White House , A@@ BC / Second .
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea .
if they make their minds , voters are real in real terms .
if they are asked who wins the G@@ G@@ P &apos;s P , the G@@ G@@ P , say , according to a run @-@ up of the last week , four that it is the best bet .
this is a change since the end of July , when four of July &apos;s four end in late July .
full disclosure : G@@ G@@ G@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , had no clear ball in the past .
at that point , four of ten Republicans thought that Governor Rick Perry won the nomination would only 28 % of the final candidates Mitt Romney .
yet it shows that a wide range of G@@ G@@ P &apos;s reputation is seen as plausible .
even if Republican collec@@ tions around another candidates , it turns out almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented competition is likely to contribute to the edge of governance , while the anti @-@ doc@@ wer , via the anti @-@ doc@@ wer , can be distributed above more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a poll of the Pope University ( Climate Times ) shows that there are a hypothetical machine - via a test transplant - the run @-@ up between scandal and the most other Republican candidates , consistent with multiple support .
he called for C@@ a@@ IA@@ co @-@ A , before Mar@@ co , three @-@ 15 minutes , before MS@@ ans , before Richard Bush , and , after all , John Paul , John Rawls , and Social Democrats , for 33 .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ the @-@ chief machine - TNC &apos;s head @-@ to @-@ the @-@ chief - go with Mrs. T@@ é@@ z .
the only candidate that he proposes ?
according to Car@@ son Car@@ son , entrepreneurs would overtake the businessmen with 19 points in a hypothetical venture - via the provision of corporate planning .

of course , much change can be done to change this , and no one can really say to change .
46 % said that they can open the door to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , the greatest competition in the moment of the other outsider , the neur@@ x@@ E of Car@@ son , voters , but voters who say that they know their opinion are double @-@ headed .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are tied to immigration immigration .
since then he called for two months ago in his campaign in his campaign in his campaign two months ago ; Royal &apos;s government was called for immigration .
some are worried that the ground@@ bas@@ tic prin@@ ts of the game is crucial to the benefit of the Republican Party , which is allowing the Republican Party , and the re @-@ emergence of government @-@ owned companies will be damaged .
but , after the new A@@ BC / World Bank , the report on six 10 Republicans , say , say that they are tied to immigration issues .
so long as immigration makes rise in the li@@ me@@ light , it seems to appear to be .
frustration with the government goes to new heights .

Europe &apos;s working crisis is back back back
Hung@@ arians declared the door with Serbia at Tu@@ ag , and held everyone who sought to halt in the country illegally , with the aim of halt the influx of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants took place in a ni@@ che country , and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
the people who have fled violence for an unknown place in a land on the streets of the country &apos;s two countries took place and built them there .
but frustrations rose .
when a police helicopter were awarded them , the migrants open the border , open the border for the border , and cra@@ ving insults against the rebelli@@ arian police .
some were back to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it would be sent out of migrants ; that migrants were sent from Hungary , while more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia wants to be part of the solution , not collateral .

bill - This survey hal@@ ved
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton remains a double @-@ digit majority in the democratic race for the national level , but Senator Senator no longer wins from the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of Democratic voters ( 58 % ) , while others are second , with 27 % ( increase by 17 % ) .
vice Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for president , offers support of 15 % of the Democratic electorate .
more than five months before at the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more serious than those of the other candidates .
since the S News , the S &amp; # 45 ;
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moderates , but such swings have diminished .
their support for men has fallen sharply , with only 5 @-@ 5 points back .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ orated , and it is now much different .
Clinton , however , has a large margin among the older voters .
last month , Clinton was the opposite head in the liberal , but no such thing is now a 5 @-@ based company , the head of the group at the head of this group .
for example , half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries would say that they would support them with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some support , and other 15 % would support them only because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s recent supporters are especially enthusiastic .
the views are more likely to support those who are not supporting Clinton - only one @-@ quarter would support them .
while 48 % of the primary People &apos;s primary candidates say that they support them with enthusiasm , voters predict less Republican voters about their top presidential candidates ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
support for dealing with the problems and benefits is quoted .
since the Vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidency , 57 % of the Democratic presidential candidates want him in the race , even though one @-@ third believe that he should not .
if democratic voters are asked to be asked for the party , who would be second of his second election , Biden is fond of the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say , there is more than half that their second election would be very different .
if Biden decides not to run the presidential nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head @-@ to @-@ day , of 20 points points to 30 points .
twenty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters view Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; but this figure has declined by 78 % last month .
Biden is close to a second element in this measure , but the percentage of the figure that I see is accelerating .
still , in the question of what is important in a candidate , the Democratic electorate is about the futility .
as in the past month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters &quot; electorate as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results in some important features of their party &apos;s primary elections .
majorities , like others , and intelligence are both honest and trusted , with strong leadership leadership .
Biden returns to three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s leadership is leadership .
thirty % of Democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that ( 15 % ) , but 27 % don &apos;t think of him .
democratic voters in the primary campaign are generally viewed as well as Clinton , different , and Biden , with their views .
in all this measure , no one @-@ quarter of Democratic voters say no opinion .
but it is another story in the US public as a whole .
half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , whereas only one @-@ third .
public opinion was divided in March , after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ like @-@ e @-@ based controversy had no effect on their broad opinions of Clinton , while 36 % said that their opinion has deteriorated even worse .
it is mainly the Republicans , more than six 10 , which say that their views of Clinton have been worse .
62 % of voters do not regard for an honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electoral vote is not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and muddle , however , receive good faith in leadership .
of the six candidates , Car@@ son , and Bush are best placed in honesty .
a majority looks different rather than honest , but , like Car@@ son , many think of him .

this will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
interest rates are rising , and the housing market will fall , bond yields will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long and how long will it last .
in particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike , and took 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s currency appreciation , not always , is often a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
as a result , representatives of the US central bank have stressed that investors should not focus when they begin to increase rates , but rather the period of opportunity for norm@@ alizing normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants , however , may find that the excitement for an interest rate may be excessive .
by contrast , we don &apos;t expect the gradual return of the US , energy yields to normal levels , but also to low levels , to rise to the true shock that many feared .
but this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a reflection of historical trends on how to respond to some areas of the economy :
as the market has seen last month , there can be long @-@ term increases in raising interest rates for a while .
once increasing increases , influence is not so dramatic .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects of stocks tend to decline in the hole cycle and return to the return of return .
recessions are economic life , but interest rates often encourage them .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that could have been unable to accelerate and accelerate recession .
the bottom line here is that GDP is close to its lowest peak in the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
according to the German bank since 1950 , total rates rose by 1@@ 4.5 % since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 % in the second quarter of 2015 , it will be expected that this will be expected , and expect only 1.5 % .
interest rates in a fragile economy may be risky and raise the question of the question ; it is this time ; indeed , the German bank said .
market participants made this year a year for the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were focused on the Doha meeting of the Federal Reserve &apos;s Open Market Committee .
while many policymakers and economists believe that the Irish M@@ C could approve an increase in the meeting , there is only a chance of 25 % .
by contrast , this is a clear slow recovery from what was the worst recession .
the current cycle is far from the longest hit the Fed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market is going to an interest rate , and the pattern is pretty much like the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks if the policy is changing .
bond yields appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle .
at the end of the pound cycle , bond yields are imminent , the German bank said .
Russian policymakers believe that the rise in interest rates will cause bond yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a drag in the curve .
what is interesting is that markets have already adapted to the Fed .
let alone ; the dollar &apos;s strength , and the decline in inflationary expectations there are some signs that the market adapted to tighter monetary policy .
short @-@ term interest rates have been growing , and volatility has been rising ; lending has spread and volatility - all of the features of the market if the Fed aggrav@@ ates their strategy .
in the large part , these companies will benefit the larger share of their business activity in the US , benefiting up interest rates , and make local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse because a rising dollar increases their output on the global market , as well as finance for their debt .
back after history shows that it is worth high @-@ quality , stocks tend to respond to three months after initial interest rates , &quot; Goldman Sachs , Goldman Sachs , &quot; in a report for customers .
firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each rate of interest rates in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital , bond yields , and low volatility in their stocks also met their counterparts with low quality ( percentage points ) and 3 percentage points ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
with a high share of flexible interest rates , Goldman Sachs will default .
outside of the world stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
depositors could see profits by higher returns , even if experts see how fast will happen .

experts criticize the Financial Services Report of cigarettes ;
claims of a state @-@ financed vehicle , which puts the amount of cigarettes less than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with the tobacco industry , researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) were taken in the British Medical Journal ( M@@ J ) , in which they criticize the study of Health Health ( PTAs ) in their report on gene , which they used to say .
P@@ TA issued the &quot; Millennium Development Report , &quot; in the past month , and I described it as a commitment to a comprehensive review of the evidence .
but some researchers questioned the resilience of the data , and had indicated links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial published in the medical journal The Lancet last month , with an excellent base , with the most important conclusion .
two other researchers write into M@@ M@@ Y , and have called for the claims of claims on the ground or sand .
McDonald &apos;s authors and Cap@@ e@@ well said that an example of the meeting was a company called the euro Health Service , whose chief executive was to receive an independent study for an independent study for an independent study .
he also called the call for the Public Health Report , they said .
one of the 12 students agreed to the meeting to obtain funds for a single @-@ estate producer - to maintain corporate producers , but not finance , which , according to reportedly , reportedly approved by the tobacco companies , set them .
the reasons for choice of the body &apos;s members will not be done , but this includes a number of corporate cigarettes - including corporate champions , which some of which some industry @-@ owned companies - are allocated to the paper .
some other participants at this point are not well known for their know of expertise , which is known in tobacco control .
at the same time , tobacco @-@ owned companies also took tobacco boards .
however , there will be no discussion of such a report .
McDonald &apos;s authors and Cap@@ e@@ well said that claims of P@@ TA , there has been no evidence that &quot; E &quot; provision - known as a road to smoking for children or non @-@ verbal goods - was premature .
Ch@@ _UNK &apos;s F@@ _UNK on Health , Director of Health and welfare , said that the claims of M@@ J had already been greeted .
he said , there is a lot less damaging than smoking .
every second life life dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that health @-@ care risks are low in comparison in comparison , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ TA &apos;s clear duty has made clear public information about what makes it , and what is especially , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks of tobacco compared to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year , and smoking costs the National Health Service for two billion per year per year .
the clear evidence that breast cancer - not risk for cigarettes , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking will meet our national responsibility .

the card is a reminder that the Fed can be allowed to set up the Fed &apos;s director .
the central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximizing the US , namely , and prices are stable .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed leaders recognize that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
back . indeed , when they were an excuse to increase the interest rate , increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough to wait for the global market , it told them .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do , leading to the financial market .
consider half of economists who recently asked Robert Bloomberg &apos;s annual rate hike this week .
financial markets , however , expect an waiting for the Fed , with a key indicator , which demonstrates only a 30 % chance .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the phrase , it is because the strategists would mitigate the blow by promising that another upturn is remote .
at the same time , the Dow annual average recorded 2@@ 2@@ 8.@@ 9 or 1.4 % by 1.4 % 16@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed &apos;s policies sustained the phrase this week , John Maynard London argued , the stock economist at Moody &apos;s Capital Group Group .
it would be a surprise if the Fed would put rates at this point ; indeed , he said .
if it does not , it would have to go too far in their own word , to reassure financial markets into panic .
other experts argued that a hike hike would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about the Fed .
a month ago , the Fed seemed to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in the spring and in the early summer , it was said that it would expect more economic progress in this year , despite the grievances of liberals who would be required more economic progress .
while employment growth slowed in August , improvement in the labor market was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level that preceded the Fed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation below the annual 2 % annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said that the main factor is the temporary impact of a lower oil prices .
the economy can be higher rates of interest rates ; indeed , it needs to manage higher interest rates , and needs to be accompanied by the market &apos;s labor market ;
but financial markets around the world ended last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow 2011 fell more than 16 % below its highs , as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth .
the market recovered in this month , with the Dow almost 10 % below the brink of May .
for the Fed , state @-@ owned enterprises influence the complex market turmoil to raise rates .
now he says that they will wait at least a month to get the implications better .
the health of the global economy is none of the central banks , so they should not become involved in their decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed of the world has become the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous in recent years .
the mere mis@@ alignment of then @-@ Prime Minister Ben Bernanke &apos;s then announced the Fed &apos;s monetary expansion in 2013 , the Fed could break its monetary expansion around the globe .
their decision @-@ making is to be a science of science ; it is a science for science .

a financial crisis in Asia raised the Fed to cut around $ 0.@@ 75 percentage points for 75 percentage points to three percentage points in three rounds , despite a limited adverse effect on growth in the US .
later a year later , the Fed used to reverse these cuts .
the Fed should put stability in a severe crisis as the market crash in 2008 , as the market crash in 2008 , said that Adam Europe , the former member of the Committee &apos;s member Committee for the Bank of England .
the recent turmoil is not close to that level , he said .
back ; you don &apos;t want to get the situation in which they are worried about an increase in an interest rate , because markets call for a bubble , said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act contains a dual mandate , not mentioned financial stability , and until that is changing , I don &apos;t think that they should be expected .

but , because the refugees and migrants of migrants have grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperately searching for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations , help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International assistance by the Chil@@ dren , the Chil@@ dren , and the United Nations , for refugees , for refugees .
Google said that the first total have doubled from 5.5 million to a value of 5.5 million from 5.5 million to $ 11 million .
Europe , with its worst problem since World War II , has been largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which killed more than 4 million people earlier this year .

Lee Myung @-@ bak &apos;s dictum ;
it is easy to have a substantial loss of loss of loss of losses .
the benefits of the weight of loss of loss of loss @-@ bearing people with non @-@ 2 diabetes can take a new study for at least five years .
it is too early to say that it is too early to say that important people with diabetes are living longer than those who don &apos;t receive - gene @-@ sponsored treatments .
the weight - proper loss of operation , gene operations , or the pri@@ mm@@ tics - is using various ways to shrink the size of the game .
they reduce hunger and limits their own ability to absorb food .
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of weight in size , is between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a M@@ B@@ M@@ M@@ A of 25 or more recently shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a M@@ B@@ I are just above 30 .
you can account for your first M@@ I : T@@ .@@ f@@ .@@ ro@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ q@@ q@@ q@@ ani .
the average M@@ M@@ M@@ I , which used the surgery , dropped from 31 to the end of the fifth anniversary of this study .
meanwhile , M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ I did not have the M@@ M@@ M@@ I for those who don &apos;t give gene @-@ care treatment around 29 .
among those who examined a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes produced by 36 % of the diabetes , only 28 % .
in the use of medical , drug companies , compared to diabetes , only about 1 % , and only around 2 % .
researchers also oversee the genetic blood mix of wild @-@ born in Al@@ c , which reflects blood gains over time .
sport is best below 7 % , which is best below 7 % .
after the operation , the average feature of around 9 % fell to around 6 % at the average level of around 9 % .
medical therapies , however , remained stable at around 8 % .
the research team compared the average results of two types of the room .
in the Swedish study , organic people who had called for a pri@@ tional laboratory operation , about 29 % in the course of 15 years ago , compared to a group that attempted more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the sur@@ ge@@ gy of the sur@@ ge@@ et@@ gy , my patients said , it is reassuring to be interested in a M@@ B@@ M@@ I with 35 who are interested in the process .
let alone is the critical point of this study , because it says that the operation at this bottom M@@ M@@ M@@ I would be low , without a higher risk of death or a kidney disease , they said .
Blackstone added that people and her doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
back , I think we will wait for a long time to wait until we help people be taken seriously ; they said .
I think that once these genetic changes have raised their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a reversal of a reversal .

after then , the man who had come to be utterly embedded in high is to have been sent into a larger cell .

they offend the human dignity of the man .
Kam@@ al court now decides the amount of compensation
even if asked for legal reasons , for legal reasons , there was only a few days for compensation for compensation .
otherwise , it would be back to a halt to the rights of the popular vote .
the indictment of a court must now resolve the amount of compensation .
constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy policy ; We are creating the door ;
immigration migration is a huge challenge - which is determined to address them .
what comes to Germany ?
around 800 asylum seekers will come next year after the German Ministry of Homeland ministry , according to Secretary of Prime Minister Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated solidarity in the face of the unusual challenge : let me again , and again ; we can create this , and we can .
what is going on Germany is the following .
the next five years will be required according to differences between 3@@ 50 ( the federal ministry &apos;s estimate of the federal ministry ) and 18@@ 50 ( the corporate Fund ) per year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been .
dramatically , however , the lack of housing is high in real estate : a daily rate of 30,000 @-@ 800,000 income from the outflow of carbon pricing , and , in particular , they are also willing to compete for refugees .
Federal Secretary of State , Secretary @-@ General , wants to double support , from around 18 million to a billion euro .
there is far too little sight : 80 @-@ year @-@ class pension funds , 80 @-@ year @-@ olds , would have to invest for $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
what is common among scientists and federal ministers is that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing .
according to the Institute of labor @-@ market and professional research , it is likely to assume that the long @-@ term 55 % of the world &apos;s debt burden can be higher .
but refugees in Germany would not be systematically needed to help them for their ability to help them .
the integration of refugees is crucial .
work is the key to social contacts , but also for the sense of the immigrants &quot; self @-@ esteem , says , say , social scientists .
in Germany , there has been a political turnaround in Germany , following a political turnaround : the work of staff for refugees to receive work .
while the work of asylum asylum for asylum @-@ seekers were used to five months , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as is the presidential race , asylum @-@ seekers abroad .
in society , as well as technical advice , the view is that refugees should be allowed to access to the labor market .
a big obstacle to the labor market is a lack of Germany .
so far , there is no excess supply of general and public schools .
research also shows that jobs are often mediated by personal contacts .
building networks , according to the view of networks , is the royal road for labor integration .
but to persuade the family from the benefits of the K@@ K@@ ese , it is distributed in various languages .
if the large number of women &apos;s demand is growing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin government would seek to increase educational capacity - say , by providing more education .
in the countries , students are prepared to be prepared for their constituents .
but they will not be taught by qualified teachers and teachers , as in Berlin , including teachers who are only a qualification in English .
for them , there is no shortage of government administration .
the German university machine estimates that around 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal asylum asylum attracted by asylum seekers or tolerated the sole exception was until Spain , the direct leader of Frank Frank ( CDU ) , has now abandoned his stance .
donor refugees could be relieved access to school education .
for refugees , or consent , get no services for the asylum of asylum @-@ seekers , if they begin to study a study .
the latter don &apos;t get a b@@ unk , because they are not burdened by the circle of the gun .
patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years in Germany to be allowed to be delivered on the ground , from January 1 , 2016 , to cut the range of 15 months .
the funding gap , too , must be closed , demanding hard @-@ pressed , Ber@@ stant secretary for science , and Germany &apos;s student company .
students should be silent immediately .
Islam will be a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are part of their identity .
the state should give Islam the same rights as the churches churches , and the existing state - via the existing churches - are entitled to a new state to a new state , including genetic bodies .
it would also be the creation of an Islamic welfare , which is more conducive to newcomers .
the rights are also duties .
for example , representatives of Islam must agree and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and provide some control of the state .
this includes willingness to act on religious fundamentalism .
the head of the Central of the Central Committee &apos;s chief of the Muslim League of Ma@@ ak , the first anniversary of concern , religious conflicts could be taken to Germany .
those who sought such conflicts in Germany , their right is their right , is their right , in Germany ; he told Burundi &apos;s radio program .
he suggested that the Basic Law suggested .
integration will be much more than today as today &apos;s society .
it will have to change the majority community of discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discriminatory , and a general law .
but it is very slow that the N@@ N@@ U , such as S@@ N@@ U , showed that police police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
in general , Germany is able to provide long @-@ awaited , medical scientists , known by Frank @-@ Da@@ o@@ az@@ ov .

but additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid shortages , Ríos Montt appears to be vet@@ ting every aspect of the use of health cards .
profits could be expected by the federal countries .
in the long run , it is highly dubious to see so many people with the limited mental @-@ services sequence , which see asylum @-@ seekers laws .
otherwise , doctors are allowed to create language barriers .
until recently , the Berlin @-@ based intellectual body has been detected , migrants will be worse off their illnesses than other patients .
not just clinics , even in clinics , would have to be taken over the cost of the cost .
to help many refugees , however , too many refugees , too , have been working in the emergency provinces .
and with another diagnostic perspective .
for example , there are far more intrusive disabilities , and the young people are about HIV @-@ based HIV .
but , with the other cause of disease , German doctors are clear for their training but clear , says Hatoyama .
land or tuberculosis is not so hard to see it hard to identify . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
the Syrians would have a high education education ; many refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their skill skills , and perhaps testing audi@@ ts .
at least half of the next few refugees , estimates by the federal Research Program ( B@@ P@@ K ) are mentally ill : most are suffering from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
the most vulnerable thing is female staff , a brand of Illinois , president of the B@@ B@@ K .
a recent study by the Munich Munich found that every fifth of Syrian women are in Germany .
those who are involved in post @-@ traumatic stress disorder suffers from the so @-@ called @-@ so @-@ called @-@ hand , sleep , heart break@@ ness , and death .
other symptoms are likely to sleep and concentration disorders , powerful mend@@ acity , and emotional do@@ ves .
to prevent the symptoms that the symptoms would be chronic , early treatment is needed .
so far , however , only four percent of the sick people now receive psycho@@ therapy .
while the mentally ill @-@ cost asylum of asylum is used to a code for psycho@@ therapy , but it takes several months of work .
moreover , social @-@ welfare workers or doctors who cannot be trained to mental illnesses decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to miscalculation , says says .
