Barack Obama
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just non @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to talk about implementation of the international agreement and more than destabilizing the Middle East .
but the denial of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ discussed &quot; state @-@ discussed &quot; states is to resolve the solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been common for years .
Washington criticized Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction , and raises Netanyahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the Obama deal has deteriorated further by the Obama deal by Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech against the US Congress - a controversial speech that Obama was regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting that rejected the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor , his friend friend shot shot .
in an emergency call , professor Sh@@ on on Lam@@ b , with a somewhat @-@ minded voice of police , would have shot his friend with his friend , and that he would have to come to his house .
Lam@@ b was important to emphasize that his mere dog is even more likely , and probably more likely to be , and he said that family tactics could be found in the cell phone .
Secretary of State , chief of chief chief Bu@@ n Bu@@ ford , said that the university staff is one of 10 .
he said that Lam@@ b has made the disastrous call at some point .
by the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ m took life when the police took place .
one day after the attack in the university , students , and D@@ centric forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to provide an image of what they are motivated .
the details of the details of the state , as well as what students who knew he knew , helped to identify an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking at his schooling .
police , where P@@ ren@@ ar died , said that he did not have a history of violence or criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lam@@ b in a book in his book , which he told his wonderful people ; he told his academic life .
both were under@@ rated in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited them .
at the same time , there were some patterns of problematic behavior .
a student , fire@@ on Be@@ a@@ on Be@@ a@@ a@@ b , the lam@@ b said , seemed to be a little more open and nervous , as if something wrong with him was wrong .
another student , For@@ el sy@@ el , told him that he told him that he had done 15 with the end of the academic crisis at the end of 2014 .
Lam@@ b was previously asked to ask the delta University for health reasons , and said that he had any health problem .
in this year , he created only two online manipulation - its prices .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the lam@@ b had worked so hard for the Lam@@ b to provide a guarantee for an automatic path to an automatic position - the official professor .
President William For@@ ge said that he says nothing about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something similar to the lam@@ b idea .
these are questions that the Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
after the run , the police later found that he went back as again in Mis@@ si@@ pp@@ pp@@ i .
his car went into travel .
it was not immediately clear why Lam@@ m went at this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew in the area .
Lam@@ b began in 2009 , with 3,@@ 3,@@ 500 students in a city with roughly 1@@ 2,000 people , and created geography and P@@ ago@@ gi@@ k .
he was in P@@ ago@@ gi@@ k spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of women described him as smart , charismatic , and gay .
Car@@ la H@@ ston said that she was 15 and Lam@@ m was 20 when they met by common friends .
they and their friends were in the high school school , and he was the co@@ co@@ y older cand@@ l , who tried some years to reconcile the prison game .
he was the women of women .
all girls go back , when he said , H@@ s@@ ston , now 40 , and in the recent city of fire@@ lo@@ on .
Lam@@ b and P@@ ren@@ ar were obviously combined with some time .
in the emergency call , I told my wife , I have killed my wife , but there was no sense of marriage .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ ing , who , with them in the B@@ a@@ stein , lived in the White House , which was divided to a Ba@@ ana .
the police said that the dog was in order .

they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
O &amp; s ; he said that he was never hit , but he had never been hit by his daughter , A@@ bi@@ b , that he was interested in music , and she played out .
Lam@@ b met P@@ ren@@ b , when he and A@@ bi@@ bi@@ s entered the summer of three years ago , two years ago .
later , they played together one or another .

P@@ ren@@ ar was a nurses who worked online for different companies .
there was no sign that anything was agreed .
it is simply a happy couple ; he said , he said .

8 poll numbers show that Donald Rumsfeld is taking seriously .
some have tried to dismiss him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
some wait for collapse .
but , no matter how some Republicans try to draw on the top of the top polls , it has not worked .
ten of the last 11 national polls showed a double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ask serious questions about what it means for the chances of the real estate of the real estate .
of course , it is too early in the electoral term .
none claims that it is likely likely to win Republican nomination .
experts emphasize that this year in 2011 has been made to rise in the rising C@@ ain C@@ ain , none of which won only one state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he would fight in a general election .
but , like Bush &apos;s conservative club of Growth and Growth Group for Growth , Bush &apos;s conservative club of Growth is now recognizing their wealth and start throwing their dollars to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that real estate - the &quot; Mo@@ gu@@ l Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
credit ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Donald announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a survey poll in Mon@@ m@@ u University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw real estate - the Mo@@ gu@@ l Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % were 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Rumsfeld .
about three of ten say that they have negative opinion .
and these numbers hold early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ac &quot; vote - a vote last week found that 60 % of Republicans have a good view of them .
two @-@ thirds of G@@ O@@ P &apos;s - O@@ O@@ P , G@@ O@@ P , would be happy with candidates as candidates .
in a poll of CNN / O@@ C last week , 67 % of the Republicans said that they were either enthusiastic ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
only two of them say that they would be angry ; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm like 43 % ( she would say that they are _UNK &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the next enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co Ru@@ co , with only 21 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they are unhappy ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
a majority of Republicans does not see an temper@@ ament as a problem .
the same number is true in the nation &apos;s first election state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a commander for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he did not have the personality in order to carry office , and almost six of 10 Independent Independent say that his temper@@ ament is not the White House , so the A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
if they are to do so , Republican voters hold real value in real terms .
if they are asked if the most likely G@@ O@@ P &apos;s nomination wins , a survey of CNN / O@@ C last week is four that the best bet is the best bet .
this is a change since four at the end of July , on the end of July .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P , the electorate in the past did not have the clear crystal ball in the past .
at this point at this cycle , four of ten Republicans thought that the nomination would win only 28 % for the final candidate Mitt Romney .
nevertheless , a variety of G@@ O@@ P &apos;s - O@@ P &apos;s campaign - seems plausible .
even if Republicans turned out to another candidate , almost everyone suggests .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the lead , while the anti @-@ the @-@ country campaign - the tri@@ ap of power on more than a dozen other candidates is distributed .
but a survey of Mon@@ r Mon@@ y@@ - at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head - the United States &apos;s head - its head @-@ of @-@ head race between most Republican candidates and most other Republican candidates .
he faces 13 points , before Mar@@ or@@ co , 14 points before Mar@@ co .
it is a head of charge - its head &apos;s head - its head @-@ of @-@ head race .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would surpass the Chinese entrepreneurs in a hypothetical head - its head @-@ of @-@ the @-@ head &apos;s head .
a scarce majority of Donald O@@ - Le@@ m@@ y@@ u , fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T on service shows that something more than half the voters who support it will say that they have their votes .
of course , much can happen to change , and no one can really say that no one can change .
46 % said that they make the door open to other candidates .
nevertheless , the strongest competition is the strongest competition at the moment of other outsiders , neur@@ och@@ g Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are linked to immigration .
since last two months since his campaign last two months ago , immigrants began from Mexico , which was called immigration , and the public discourse is in 2016 .
some are worried that the bas@@ tic appearance of a crucial _UNK o - Americans will keep the Republican Party away from the Republican Party , and that will damage re @-@ fulfilling efforts .
but , after the new A@@ BC / Post poll , six from 10 Republicans say that they are linked to immigration issues .
so , as long as immigration is in the spotlight , it will seem to do so .
frustration about the government is spreading to new highs .
on Donald Donald Rumsfeld and Ben Car@@ son , roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially by its maver@@ ick , is now its status .
six of 10 Republicans say in the new mon@@ mon@@ day - a survey poll by A@@ BC / Post , they prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .
Munich , Munich , and Germany : the five exclusive neighborhoods of Germany
here , here is the most expensive housing plant , with the northern country .
in the streets , a square square of a house house would cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
by contrast , the supply of objec@@ ts is limited by limited research , i.e. , the study - so the high price .
a new study shows a new square in which special countries cost a square square .
of course , 18@@ 70 per square square for a student in Munich is not really little .
Germany &apos;s top price , however , comes at the price of its peak .
real estate - service @-@ service boards &amp; amp ; &amp; amp ;
there are several thousand thousand kilometers per square square .

incidentally , Munich , for once , is not at the top .

who is taking a higher risk , there is a risk of losing teeth .
who is doing so , it harms not only L@@ L@@ s , but also that suggests that he suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news is that the risk declines quickly .
smokers have a clear risk of losing their teeth early .
this emerges from the long @-@ term study of an international team team , including several employees of the German Institute for nutrition research ( D@@ E ) .
compared to non @-@ trust , there was the risk of losing their teeth in order to lose 2.@@ 5@@ 5@@ - by 3.6 @-@ 3.6 .

the main causes of the failure of the shortfall are K@@ K@@ ar and a to@@ p of to@@ p , stresses the D@@ e E .
for these Par@@ o@@ tis , smoking is emphasizing the authors .
thus , the link between smoking and the loss of death is therefore more common to a more frequent to@@ age .
moreover , smoking is not the risk for smoking .
people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk within short , but write the researchers &quot; Journal of D@@ ar Research . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;

the EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute in T@@ T@@ T@@ T@@ A , a new court court
on the resolution of the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement , the European Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ation system .
the controversial private resolution facilities between corporations and states should thus be replaced by a more transparent system that is equivalent to much more traditional courts in his way .
for us , we want to establish a system that citizens trust the EU , the Council of the Union , C@@ ec@@ ec@@ i@@ i@@ m Mal@@ m@@ m , was in the notion of the EU .
the Swe@@ din has faced the proposal as a European bargaining position in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
by T@@ T@@ s , the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade area is supposed to emerge with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current referee procedures look concrete that the EU - the United States and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they are supposed to come from equal parts from the EU , the US , and third states .
the first time is , for the first time , a second resort .
it would allow them to object .
so far , the rules involved agreed on the referee , whose judgments were not opposed to their judgments .
in the discussion of recent months , citizens have become clear that the old result - the system of fairness and justice in fairness and justice was trusted .
in the long run , they want to work on a national investment court .
then , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU could be resolved .
above all , large @-@ scale investors , especially in the company , demanded the form of default - official arbit@@ ation ) , as one of the main reasons for the big opposition in Europe .
traditional legal courts are criticized as a kind of parallel justice , with companies criticized by taxpayers at the expense of taxpayers , the national laws , or to reduce consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements called anti @-@ policy statements - the T@@ T@@ E , organizations such as C@@ amp@@ s - the Commission &apos;s proposals are inadequate - the Commission &apos;s proposals .
it was especially criticized that they are not supposed to apply to the free @-@ trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
German Secretary of State Mat@@ al Mat@@ thi@@ as ( Social Democrats ) called the plans as much progress .
the Commission is considering key issues that the federal Minister of Foreign Minister Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel announced in the spring with other EU officials - its trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ation is the table .
the French government also welcomed the Mal@@ m@@ m &apos;s plans .

he called for fewer theater and more facts .
he also said that he could take some meetings to leave them to colleagues .

pound is rising by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom

between May and July , the result of bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % relative to the same time period .

Europe &apos;s post @-@ crisis crisis : Hungary keeps refugees back , refugees
Hungary declared the emergency emergency , and followed the southern border with Serbia , and held everyone who tried to be illegal in the country , all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
chaos followed in the border when hundreds of migrants responded in a Ni@@ em@@ eland country , and Serbian officials responded with outrage .
the people who fled before violence were an unknown time in the street between the two countries &quot; two @-@ party control and built @-@ up .
but frustrations rose .
as a police favorite over them , migrants turned out ; the border ! &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
some had returned from food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it unacceptable ; migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants part of the solution , not collateral damage .
it must take place in Brussels and other countries in the coming days , said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turmoil in the Serbian border - a day after the 28 nations - was able to reconcile a common immigration policy after a divisive meeting in Brussels .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit for the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for an early action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency emergency in two southern regions gave more powers to managing the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum seekers .

in recent months , Hungary has become a substantial reference to the European Union and the European Union in the Middle East .
as a result of mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state .
we say it is very clear : illegal borders are a crime .
the parliament must still agree to the military &apos;s use for next week , but reporters on the border have hard armed soldiers , and have already seen armed soldiers .
N@@ or@@ di Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s National Security Council , said that authorities were trying to run the border with the border , 15 others had already gone deeper into the country .
they come from the fence by damaging them now in police police , and will be accused of charges of new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials , too , joined two of the seven marginal borders with Serbia , after a car train with a car train to close borders .
about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important
election - The Clinton poll , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head in the national poll
former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit race in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ an never wins .
Clinton now has the support of 47 % of democratic voters ( 58 % ) , while S@@ 1 % is second , compared to 27 % ( 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency , receives 15 % of the democratic electorate .
more than five months ago , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they will support their candidates .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more permanent than those of the other candidates .
since the
Clinton holds a big margin for women and moderates , but they have reduced it .
their support for men has fallen sharply , and S@@ 5 is very different here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters below 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now equal .
Clinton , however , has a big margin for the older voters .
last month , Clinton was different from a two @-@ month margin of liberals , but Saleh has now now has a 5 @-@ 5 @-@ 5 issue - the result of this point .
for example , half of the democratic voters of the electorate would say that they would support them with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them , and another 15 % would support them only because they are the candidate .
six % would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about their supporters .
views are more likely to support those who do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support them .
while 48 % of voters &quot; Democratic voters say that they support Clinton , less Republican voters say this about top candidates ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
approval of the problems and voting is also quoted as well .
as Vice president raises a president &apos;s potential for the presidency , 57 % of the democratic voters believe him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked to be asked who the party would be their second election , Biden is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Biden would be different from the second election .
if Biden decides not to run the party &apos;s nomination , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head of the lead , from 20 points to Biden , increased on 30 points without the race .
fifty % of democratic voters view Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election ; but this number has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second of this measurement , but the percentage of the percentage of which he views him as one of the most likely . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
yet , with the question of what candidates are more important in one candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting predictability .
like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters emerged as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are good results in some important characteristics among voters &quot; minds .
majorities consider Clinton , S@@ S@@ Biden , and Biden as honest and trustworthy and strong leadership .
Biden is top of the three candidates at the best of honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty % of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , as many say about 15 % ( 15 % ) , but 27 % do not believe him .
democratic voters generally see Clinton , Saleh , and Biden in consensus with their views .
with all of these measures , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters no different view .
but there is another story in the American public .
half of Americans now unhappy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E @-@ mail - the controversy had no impact on its general views from Clinton , though 36 % said that their opinion has worsened .

that will happen if the Fed increases the interest rate increases
interest rates will come , and homeowners will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long it will take , and how long it will last .
in particular , the story provides only small bond yields for the economy .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate , and took 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness of interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond .
thus , the representatives of the United States Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
at the end of market participants , however , market participants may find that the whole excitement of an interest rate may be exaggerated .
by contrast , we expect not to return the gradual return of US debt - interest rates still too low at low levels , to the shock that many seem to fear .
but this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is one of historical trends that may respond to how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen last month , raising interest rates can make things volatile for some time .
once the increase is true , influence is not so dramatic .
the German bank said that the impact on stocks tends to emerge later in the cycle , and the return begins to reduce .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but they often promote interest rates .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that had not previously occurred and could accelerate recession .
remarkably remarkable here , GDP near its lowest rate of interest rates will be near the Fed .
according to the Deutsche Bank , 1@@ 18 rate hikes have only been below 4.5 % since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect this to last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rate hikes could be risky , and may be risky , whether this time is different ; it said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made this year at the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Reserve meeting this week .
while many economists and economists believe that the M@@ C could provide an increase in this meeting , the futures market is only 25 % .
by contrast , this is clearly slow recovery , which was the worst recession in the winter .
the current cycle is far from the longest Fed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , because the market is a rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the market &apos;s capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks when their strategic course changes .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase in the cycle is cut .
at the end of the cycle , bond yields immediately fall , the Germans said .
Charles Charles &apos;s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a flat curve .
interesting , says that markets have already adjusted for the Fed - the Fed &apos;s policy - expectations are adjusted .
by contrast , the dollar &apos;s strength and decline in inflationary expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to tighter monetary policy , it wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , raising credit rates have increased , and volatility has increased - all the features of the market if the Fed has exacerbated its strategy .
big companies will benefit from the larger part of their business activity in the US , if interest rates are rising , and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market , and as well as financing of their debt .
history shows that quality &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points in 1994 , with any weak record of interest @-@ rate hikes in 1994 , in 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital - yields and low volatility in their stocks met their counterparts with low quality by average ( percentage points ) and 3 percentage points .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , Goldman Sachs said .
outside the pure stock markets , consumers will also benefit through the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher returns , even if experts are different , how quickly will happen .

R@@ z@@ ke : violence at Serbian border - Serbian border border
the Hungarian police has used the Serbian border with R@@ z@@ ke _UNK as and water workers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ov &apos;s promise - D@@ e@@ ni@@ el B@@ oz@@ ics has witnessed the violence at the border control of the border .
he reported .
one group of refugees collapsed .
there was a police line behind the police line , and the police were ready for water .
40 until 50 refugees began to start with one , and to throw pl@@ as@@ ers into civil servants .
officials initially prevailed un@@ interrupted .
then the police used the police .
there was a lot of refugees in the direction of refugees .
the group was dissolved .
refugees have now withdrawn somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently wounded woman was borne out of the zone .
children who had had so did so did so soon .
other refugees were united and suffered from the breath .
the press pre@@ aches of Serbian police , too , suffered injury by the use of _UNK as and P@@ ing@@ y .
time for the decision to decide interest rates for the US Federal Reserve - the central bank
the world is observed if the US Federal Reserve comes together at two days , on the day and D@@ urs@@ day , to make the important decision whether for the first time for nearly a decade , the first time has been raised or not .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed used interest rates on zero .
the US economy - the economy is relatively good for good performance , is added to the balance sheet , and generate only low inflation .
but the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions .
they warned markets to increase , but the signs suggest that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision is to be known at the day of the clock , the MDGs will be known at the first day ,

Lam@@ b told the staff of the emergency staff that the police must send police at home .
police asked him for his name , but he did not exist .
Lam@@ b was no explanation for his sheep .
I loved am@@ am@@ y , and it is the only woman who ever loved me .
after the writing of the Lam@@ b , 300 miles of the delta University , where he took E@@ E@@ Schmidt , killed a professor for history before he finally took his own life on the Mon@@ day Day when he took him out .
President William For@@ ge said that he says nothing about a conflict between Lam@@ b and Schmidt , but , of course , there was something similar to the lam@@ b idea .
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ ti@@ er has been described by Sha@@ O O &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
the two were left for 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &amp; s ; he said , he and P@@ ren@@ ti@@ er would have a daughter that is 19 , and they are destroyed ; they are destroyed .
he said that P@@ ren@@ er had its daughter , the best friends of friends . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
P@@ ren@@ ti@@ er worked online from home , according to the statement of L@@ ar , which was identified as a close friend as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ ine .
i@@ w@@ w@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ al who had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ ing had met for about three years of Lam@@ b .
you wanted to help , and you wanted to help other people ;
the police said that Lam@@ b was called at a certain time on Mon@@ day to tell them ; he did not go into prison .
as police officers close him near this night , close to a Gre@@ b close to this night , the lam@@ b fired his car , went into the forest , and killed themselves with a shot .
Lam@@ b received a Ph@@ doc@@ b in the spring of 2015 , as his university &apos;s Web site has taken place in the spring of 2015 .

the show players are supposedly fighting with drugs , and he was sentenced to drug users in 2008 .
all of this is certainly his toll .
Eur@@ th@@ ar is Eur@@ th@@ a : air strikes
air strikes are planning a big corporate construction .
a half @-@ billion euro , a year of air strikes , wants to save the corporation alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 executives will cost the workplace .
but there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
air strikes are building their corporate structure , and is the cost of a low @-@ cost Eur@@ g@@ ar .
the goal of rebalancing is roughly $ 500 million per year from cost and salvation , with the airline company on the ground .
among other things , there is no board more for a business board for air strikes .
the low @-@ cost Eur@@ im Eur@@ ar should always be developed as possible as possible .
at the head of the head of the CEO , Karl the ultra @-@ rich city of Eur@@ Sachs will be responsible .
with the re@@ position , it underscores the importance of Eur@@ ala &apos;s importance to which the corporation wants to go against Ryanair and E@@ asy@@ al .
so far , the company &apos;s 120 was complex .
the airlines under the ro@@ age of Air@@ or@@ age group , under the three @-@ quarters of the annual rate of sales of $ 30 billion .
new negotiations
in the political dispute with the Co@@ b@@ o Co@@ g@@ o ( V@@ C ) , the negotiations are supposed to be re @-@ absorbed after the right @-@ wing strike .
that shared the union .
the issue of talks is supposed to be pilots .
Co@@ z@@ ly , a year , with a predicted record @-@ predicted outcome , as soon as possible .
the conflict between trade union and Air@@ kes led to strikes in recent months .
against the background , along with transitional supplies , it is the austerity concept . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
it looks like the fight against the fight against the competitors of the company &apos;s own low @-@ cost &quot; low @-@ cost . &quot;
under the title of murder in the south , it is not to see Le@@ le@@ er Le@@ le@@ er .
the long @-@ term Finland , for the White House , has put together a choice of choice working together , which gives their thinking to a trip .
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w &apos;s Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w cannot play a double deal for months because of a double deal ,
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered with the United League &apos;s champions - the defeat of his defeat by P@@ Lu@@ V ri@@ ves , a double @-@ wing fragility of his right .
while this will exclude the left and exclude him at least six months from the Games , Louis van G@@ a@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
injury was caused by a reckless attack from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15@@ th , after 20 years old @-@ old Sha@@ w has collapsed in the P@@ V .
he was treated with nine minutes on the playing field before he was brought into hospital .
van G@@ a@@ al said : E@@ r has a double deal , and lies in hospital .
he will become tomorrow , or perhaps a day later , and then operates in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United States , it is very hard to play , and then it is happening .
he had had the former p@@ ine .
he did .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double deal , then the six months will be , and he will not play in the group .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy , a Red card , and the imposition of a El@@ f@@ ard .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ puzzle , the referee , has not punished Mexicans .
van G@@ a@@ al said that the Italian referee was wrong .
they can judge themselves if I say that a El@@ ese card was a red card .
it was a very severe attack with both .
in fact , the loss of Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffers from defeat in P@@ Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffers from defeat in P@@ Lu@@ V S@@ V .
in England , the defender of the European defender has an additional incentive to recover from France until the next June .
on Co@@ p Co@@ p , P@@ V , S@@ V , said , said : It is a very bad injury . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
if a players rely on this kind of injury , all are very sad about this .
it is never the intention of our players to violate opponents .
Moreno suffered a slump when Mexico was played as a Holland @-@ Dutch team at the World Cup in 2014 .
E@@ r , hard because it was not his intention of violating the opponents , and if you hear that it is very bad injury , it is not good .
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
in conversation with S@@ .@@ 6 , I said : I knows how it feels , I knows how hard it can be .
I am very bad for me .
the P@@ V S@@ V - Gu@@ ar@@ o Gu@@ ar@@ o ) has also brought into hospital into a hospital , after a l@@ ou@@ el game of Chris S@@ ou@@ o .
certainly David Cameron knows better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loved your book , it will not take long until you know it .
it is if you are David Cameron .
when he asked from a providers of child @-@ care systems - his favorite message - his prime minister , The prime minister , The An@@ a@@ x of 1971 , the 1971 @-@ 1971 environment , in 1971 , decided to be hot .
most likely , such a relatively low public @-@ relations task - the task of a heroism that has not read a 20 times a child .
a D@@ O@@ E - The judge said that the text is likely to have come from Cameron &apos;s constituencies .
the super@@ game confirmed that Cameron &apos;s text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th has clearly threatened from the exclusion of Belarus &apos;s team , but it is still hard to find it still difficult to find it difficult , but it is still difficult to find it difficult .
I would not rule out an exit .
with the ball , Mo@@ eums Ali , Bo@@ w@@ w@@ ler , and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ am , even if he is a unknown test of the test , is an option for the attack .
the news message : Adam N@@ th is being replaced by the test of England - the review of its cadres , and is replaced by Ale@@ x .
the decision to let Adam G@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze me as his chief leader in Yor@@ sh@@ ire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that krill players are directed at results .
there was no question of the question of Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and this led to the nomination , as I have said , and I said that players are their own best .
long ago , it would have been extended by Libya , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopes that he hopes for further purchases for the Yor@@ sh@@ ire , another chance comes .
the England of England - Som@@ li@@ ly praised his stance , even if he was not so good , he didn &apos;t surprise me , and he is not surprisingly surprised ; he is especially a team of the team .
the question of how much time is a test of the test is hard to sign his sign .
it was seven opportunities - like Sam ro@@ son before him - during N@@ ick nine .
only just received the chance of home and shelter .
the only charge that it can rise was that England was first held in the Caribbean - as it was in the peak - but that lost opportunity is now in the past .
Ale@@ x Ale@@ x comes , and he is a dog that I am high .
he is a &quot; X factor , &quot; that we saw , what we saw in the election season , as we saw 2@@ 36 in the season , when he met 2@@ 36 .
he must at least receive the same opportunities like him , but this depends on the team of the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of leaving Mo@@ eums alongside Cook , which would be used as a result - for the promise of the official Bo@@ w@@ ler and four Qu@@ ic@@ ler , and I have nothing to be opposed .
I don &apos;t see why a dog can &apos;t beat there , and these Lin@@ k@@ ers have already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricket - the message players .
Mo@@ eums may not have his job for his Coun@@ ty work@@ sh@@ ire , but he is a number of 3 to them , and there is no big difference .
my earlier team , a former team , played his first 38 tests before the first drug before he resigned in 2001 .
he did three hundred of us immediately , and did not come back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes in the wake of the country as a result - the result of the back@@ up of the back@@ up - as well as in my limited handling of his young man , he was impressed as a young man .
he will learn to do so .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise supplements .
the appointment of Mah@@ e J@@ ay@@ ay@@ y , the battery of Sri Lanka , could be a master@@ piece for the test of test games .
he is one of the test of the game , which has played an abundance of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul F@@ ing@@ ing@@ les come for the white cow - the stage of the stage , and brings energy and powerful use in the S@@ et@@ p .
I felt always that he was created for international policy competition , as players or players , and , as Mah@@ ela , he can benefit from the insights that we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring new voices in wind , even if the news is in accordance with that before .
the team of D@@ HA@@ M &apos;s team in D@@ HA@@ M , Ben Ben _UNK , is not used in the one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ year - Australia , a similar pause against Australia , and I do not have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but code codes and team will not determine the timetable .
and you must think that as players depend on their jobs , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions will not be met .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp - Britain &apos;s exit to the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy is to get in a slack , if the economy goes into a slack ,
foreigners , too , have their cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and kidney color .
in British ton , T@@ gh@@ ton decided that it may not threaten them if they threaten social protection .
we could also call it , as well as , to be a rare @-@ earth , self @-@ fulfilling agenda .
Prime Minister and the finance minister and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , one of a famous local monument , or without local wealth , will come home and say that they gain allies for reform .
it is always about me .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or his launch in 201@@ 7 .
he is also a declining force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain .
as a result , some of such ministers may , even as a result , not be helpful , as in Britain &apos;s referendum campaign , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , is supposed to accelerate my friend .
re @-@ renegoti@@ ation was a default , and Britain has nothing of the value of the renegoti@@ ation .
in all of his neglect , he knew who was his enemies .
this was the part of the tax of the tax - the tri@@ g@@ ley of the ro@@ w@@ l , telephone , telephone , foreigners , and pseudo @-@ &quot; non @-@ the @-@ country &quot; countries - that of most of our big newspapers .
in fact , Tony Blair thought similar to them , but found that if you are in a cage , you are distributed in a cage to divert him rather than to eat his fellow day and dinner .
the press never won him .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not to me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s BBC , he has relied on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position is Europe - I am friendly to development .
he says that we should remain in a reformed EU .
now , most people outside the U@@ om corps of traditional blocs - the tendency - and the wild fil@@ ters of the folly of the tor@@ om - that can be said , everyone can say yes .
I reminded me of the 70 @-@ year issue , when his old father sought to be loyal to his Labour , his cabinet cabinet , without losing too far , and to lose his cabinet .
aid &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to keep support in the referendum campaign for granted as Mc@@ D@@ ell .
Simon J@@ u &apos;s thinking is certain to be sure .
as with its ambiguity in NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that J@@ C is not a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will try to try to find sense in particular for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be all useless ?
experts &quot; report from England &apos;s public Health report - cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency - government @-@ funded cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industries .
experts that write the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ Y ) joined the Lancet by criticizing the Health Health Health Organization ( PTAs ) in its report on the report - cigarettes used to criticize cigarettes .
R &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
but some researchers have challenged the resilience of data , and had the links between some experts and tobacco industries .
an editorial in the medical journal last month launched an extraordinarily Indian foundation based on an extraordinarily important conclusion .
two other researchers write in B@@ M@@ Y , and asked whether the claims are built on the sand or sand . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
Mc@@ Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ ur said that a company called a company called Euro@@ Health , whose chief director previously asked by British American funds ( asked ) to receive an independent study .
he wrote also the credentials of the public health report on a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants said at the meeting , one of the funds that have been used by the R@@ E - to obtain its producers , but not the funding that he was supposed to have received in the previous reports of tobacco companies , the International Monetary Fund , was added to them .
the reasons for choosing the body &apos;s members will not be delivered , but they are included by several known R &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how .
at the meeting , the tobacco panel also took place .
but none of these ties or restrictions on the United E report is discussed .
Mc@@ Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ e@@ am said that there has been no evidence that there has been no evidence that there has been no evidence that it has been premature - cigarettes as a road to smoking for children or non @-@ trust . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45

he said : R &amp; # 160 ;
every second lifetime life dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of R &amp; # 45 ;
PTAs have the clear duty to information about the public , which is not proven , especially if there are much public confusion about the relative dangers to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die per year on smoking , and smoking costs two billion per year the National Health system .
the clear evidence that the current evidence is not due to the current evidence - that cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is our national jurisdiction .
BBC , a former leader , should give up 4 .
Johnson said that the car fee should be used only to make the type of programs that not by the other United Kingdom .
he criticized the BBC - that they are likely to be seen by public programs that are likely to be seen in a smaller audience .
if you want to keep the car fee , which I don &apos;t want a good idea for the medium term , its production should be made at least on programs that others do not make or mandate .
they send bird ice in a high @-@ class time because they want to achieve broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course , nonsense .
Johnson said : I do not see why a re@@ re@@ financed tax tax financed without subsidies .
the bird ice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ ders , another , admittedly both self @-@ interest .
honest said , other channels would give their right .
I see me as to public television , as to public television .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
they lay in a time when no one wanted to see them .
for the hospital fee , Johnson told the Committee : I asked you to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions who can receive the best value of the value .

the video shows how they will change the direction in the direction that they will become with K@@ lan@@ lan@@ sen .
scientists have a s@@ mer with genetically modified nerve systems that can be managed by all waves of waves .
the tiny weather changes are changing the moment when they are heard with K@@ lan@@ lan@@ sen , which will be heard too high for human beings to become heard .
the stimulus is working through the intimidation of the old engines - of its cells that are genetically changed in order to bear the M@@ n Le@@ n &apos;s channels - that respond to the ultra @-@ rich waves .
another subject to this issue : researchers read and write brain activity with light light activity with light .
F@@ worms usually react not to ultra @-@ ultra , but C@@ hal@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ op@@ op@@ ic air bubbles .
bubbles , he found , reinforce the ultra @-@ rich waves that then enter the worms .
the broader waves of waves are working on structures that have been called the TR@@ P - O@@ 4 @-@ 4 ) .
the waves of all @-@ waves will make the opening of these I@@ HC channels , and the cells that they are allocated to the report are such a report .
in order to create
when he relies on ultra @-@ modified cre@@ ds , the waves are reinforced by micro @-@ micro@@ waves and transfer into the worms , where they changed the change of engines .
the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ ons , a breaking To@@ ol , which allows scientists to eliminate neurons with the stimulus of the lights .
but C@@ hal@@ ani said that there could have some benefits to technology .

one of the Par@@ o@@ --@@ shows the charge that was produced by a special patent Group .
according to G@@ av@@ tics , C@@ ru@@ ol De@@ ol , and D@@ oz@@ ent at the University of E@@ ss@@ ex , artists are critical , and try to try to bring political work to the audience outside of the .
many artists do themselves with protest movements in protest and notice that they must go out in the real world , so that their art has a influence on society .
another of the &quot; anti @-@ arms @-@ trading &quot; - the sc@@ ol@@ ers do not see the counterpart of the sub@@ U .

eight golden rules for life in student homes
most of what I learned can become eight simple rules .
the advent of student prices , too , is slightly too terrifying .
call you .
and you help others to do the same - you ask questions and show you interest .
you draw the conversation and help people to find that you would not speak with whom you would not speak , even if your whales were caught into fire and fire fire .
let &apos;s people .
in fact , you don &apos;t think to start with a relationship
content received a big treatment in the university .
this can be hell for someone who tried to recover .
try to feel when a com@@ one of neo @-@ militant is exhausted - and send him a text to him .
A@@ po@@ po@@ l@@ s : you do .
a cand@@ l in my student homes had the idea that an un@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship is close .
there is also a good way to offer their own devices , a good way to close friends .
their fellow people feel obliged to deal with themselves , and perhaps the face of your face will be surprised .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bear .
ill @-@ managed mon@@ mon@@ es from flo@@ l , sugar , and fat lead people to imagine that if you are le@@ ank@@ ed .
food for food is an extended crime in student homes .
of course , it is a grain of theft , but is it the N@@ N@@ x of a drought for your tea ?
review that .
the chances are good that they use themselves to service themselves , even if they do .
if someone is wrong , you have that , and you have my compassion - but you try to deal with a more balanced than my fellow who added to her milk to punish a th@@ iev@@ er .
it is now in prison .
they should not make no people who are holding people from or from work .
it is not only about to be a decent person , but that you are in literally the sense of the people who are sitting on people who are in the glass house .
a girl asked for my neighbors , they asked their neighbors , whether to put the printing sport , because it was three clock , and she had a test on the morning .
they responded with even lower music .
when they finally heard around 5 clock , they kept their neighbors sleep even two hours before they allowed their own music to break their door , and turned out to their three scrutiny .
would it not be romantic if your future marriage happens to happen in the same student &apos;s homes ?
of course , the heart of its own way - but if a hot complicity in your future is not one of your future marriage , you try to talk to a little reason .
at the very moment you notice that someone can always be the key in his non @-@ existent line , the border is between an ultra @-@ ultra and M@@ ob@@ ob@@ le , as it seems .
a good rich is a good thing , but it takes only moments until he will become the B@@ ang .
let you get a valuable and am@@ am@@ le lesson about security - but you never get someone &apos;s Z@@ am@@ o Z@@ am@@ a and Sh@@ am@@ po@@ o .
let you turn their door , and you are their key to a glass water that you will make you fresh , but you don &apos;t send their ownership to their ownership twice .
of refugees
real estate @-@ market entrepreneurs are building in the medium @-@ size health houses of people who do not have much money .
so , for example , refugees - as well as a signal : not only refugees need housing , but also the single mother and the low @-@ income earners .
I wonder , as I can do well and well , I can do well , as well as the 44 @-@ year interview , J@@ J@@ J@@ an interview in the interview
thousands of refugees will push the housing market .
market entrepreneurs know how rapidly low @-@ estate homes can be created : he is building in a project @-@ building project for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ d@@ ner , many refugees are pushing the housing market .
what solution ?
market @-@ market Gil@@ us : mass under@@ selling or to@@ k is not sustainability .
for people remain much here here .
given the refugee storm , we need enough housing in the next decades .
a more banal , triple travelers , is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : a travelers of rice needs least place .
it makes it easier for integration .
this is different if it brings people to housing .
each of the six houses that is just built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two sleep room , a bad place , a cows , and a drug area .
it can be that many refugees will say that it is again peace , I am back .
then houses can easily be built after the needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : the price of square square kilometers per house is in 18@@ 4 euros , without ground .
this is manageable .
six months took construction .
this is appropriate .
have construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : construction I have made my project correct .
particularly complicated , it is always the threat of the looming dam construction and the formal order of order .
green .
it will always be made by those who create a friction from three homes , at least three .
only cities lack place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the people respond to their travelers on the rice project ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : there was the accused of creating luxury luxury asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable homes ?
in fact , we were true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but they were luxury housing , which can hardly afford to afford .
my project has the message , including ordinary people .
not only refugees , but just the single mother or the low @-@ income earners .
I understand how to build well and well .
this is why it is .

Slovenia does
the American government was previously told , Slovenia , to return to refugees and refugees in Austria and Germany , and may also create cor@@ cor@@ ors for refugees .
as a whole , the interior minister , V@@ es@@ na , was not seen in L@@ ai@@ ic L@@ ai@@ an .
the idea of cor@@ ors are absolutely unacceptable ; Slovenia , rather , will intensify the border - especially Hungary - .
the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outside border .
as the ministerial minister emphasized , it does not want to break its borders on refugees .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;

Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphasized that his country has prepared for the case of a strong range of refugees plans for possible exceptional situations .
he was not called out , but he pointed out that Croatia was not a &quot; Schengen &quot; - the Schengen member - a comprehensive member of the border control . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
strict controls are designed to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia belongs to the EU since 2007 , the EU partner , since then , has made it a good effect since the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , there remain roughly 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border .
according to media reports , they would have spent last night in the border horror that leads to R@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border horror and B@@ i B@@ i remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to go to travel now is unclear .
it would not now pay very high refugee refugees .
it could not be said whether they would continue their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
workers are dangerous to migrants - dangerous workers -
but private professionals have already begun to distribute refugees to refugees , which are marked by the alternative routine by Croatia .
the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there are still non @-@ min@@ ted min@@ min@@ ers after the end of Croatia &apos;s war of war .

looming about them at an end to the two @-@ minded customs system , the United States is looming .
the card is a reminder that the Fed is the Fed - head of President Jan@@ et L@@ et and their colleagues to put the nation &apos;s economic interests from all other things .
the central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximizing US @-@ led US employment and prices here .
but since the big recession , the Fed has recognized that it has a unwritten mandate : financial stability .
but , if I think that they were not seeking to raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market remains enough justification for waiting ; it said .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do to do what the financial market is concerned .
for example , half the economists who were asked recently about Bloomberg have predicted this week &apos;s interest rate hike .
financial markets , however , expect the Fed to wait for a key Indian economy , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the Fed increases the phrase that strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on the service day , the average average was 2@@ 8.@@ 2@@ 8.@@ th , or 1.4 % at 16@@ 5@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed - the Fed is holding the phrase in this week , John John London , chief economist at Moody &apos;s &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
it would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this time , he said , he said .
if she does , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm financial markets , lest they panic .
other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets , because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month ago , the Fed seemed good for good ways to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in the slow monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery .
Y@@ st@@ mer had said in the spring and early summer that it was required this year despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be required to increase the rise .
although job creation slowed in August , improving the labor market was solid this year .
unemployment fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the idea that the Fed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said - its representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy can be done ; it can manage higher interest rates , and needs them for the labor market .
but financial markets around the world ended last month after China devalued its currency .
the Dow average average fell more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slowdown in China &apos;s economy would cut global growth .
the market has recovered this month this month , with the Dow now almost 10 % below May .
for the Fed , the market turmoil affects the complex calculations of when you should raise interest rates .
now he says that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
the health of the global economy is none of the Fed &apos;s main concern , so it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making .
but the Fed has become the Fed &apos;s currency authority .
the central bank &apos;s influence was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could become its monetary expansion , which could be narrow , triggered confusion around the globe .
their decision @-@ making is more than science . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
L@@ lit@@ al , the United States Federal Reserve Committee , for an interest rate hike , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 , for example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings ; despite limited effects on growth in the US , he said .
a year later , the Fed has reversed these cuts .
the Fed should put financial stability only at the first time during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 said Adam Adam Po@@ sen , a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest .
the recent turmoil is not near this level , he said .
you certainly don &apos;t want to get the situation in which they are afraid of a hike in markets , because markets said , he said , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , and not the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that it should be expected time .

one recent study under the study of Robert Water@@ eland , professor on the College of Texas College in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tumors .

as a result , a study of the results of social construction is the result .
compared to this year , Germany will deal 2@@ 60,000 units in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their homes to live in the first time of asylum .
many then run the housing market , and they are running in long @-@ term homes .
according to the federal government , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were used in the last year .
but the negative development of the housing market is not only paid to rising refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is a housing deficit that will be larger by year .
at the current time , roughly 7@@ 0,000 housing units have already been accused of 7@@ Mat@@ thi@@ as Ch@@ as , his author .
many of this is why many big cities have failed in the G @-@ European cities .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily due to the housing market in the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square kilometers per capita has declined in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &apos;s alliance is beginning to start with social construction . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
new incentives are supposed to revive social housing .
as a result , the green tax could be lost , and the basic tax on temporary homes could be exposed .
moreover , the Alliance is needed for attractive tax opportunities .
the subsidy program for the State Bank &apos;s refugee program is already good for cities and communities .
a good week after the start was reached by 18@@ 4 million after 18@@ 4 million more than half of the euro &apos;s € 300 million .
now the project could even rise .
refugees are free : Croatia and Slovenia
after Hungary , Hungary is virtually no longer , because more refugees choose the path of Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ b suggested that the trip to the north is without hurdles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to join the neighboring Slovenia about the establishment of a basket of refugees .
I have spoken ; I talked with the interior minister , and if we are necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ri@@ dor , said the American interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria , and is already one of Schengen - the Schengen zone .
the EU - Croatia &apos;s country is not yet a Schengen - country .
after the denial of Serb , the Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken after Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people have come about the border with To@@ To@@ L , reported in the American television television station .
Hungary had had its border for refugees .
new legislation that joined the same day in the same day makes decent asylum @-@ seekers in Hungary virtually redundant .
Croatia wants to happen to refugees .
the anti @-@ Prime Minister in Mill vi@@ vi@@ c declared : you can travel , and we are preparing us for this possibility . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
these people are people , women , children , and men who want to live and achieve something .
but people who wanted to live in Croatia are not people who wanted to live in Croatia .
the American police had hit the first refugees at the line of Serbia &apos;s border with the EU - the country of neighboring Croatia .
according to most media reports , Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan report reports .
they came with both the B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ en into the Serbian border city .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to take foot over Croatia &apos;s border .
in the anti @-@ Serbian border , the Serbian refugees do not run the refugees .
there are other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
min@@ e@@ min@@ ers are now supposed to create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there is little more refugees after closing the border .
by service , the police took 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the Mon@@ day , it was 9@@ 9@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are to overcome the overcoming and compensation of the puzzle as a criminal offense .
so , in the southern border city of the border , 35 criminal proceedings have been launched .
the condemnation is threatening to prison in prison for five years and wrong .
according to the immigration authority , the immigration authority was re@@ established in the border . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
among producers are 13 families with small children , as well as two older people .
tomorrow &apos;s fellow refugees would have stopped there .
but no one has given more chance to get asylum in Hungary .
after that view , Serbia is one of a secure third @-@ third . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
asylum seekers are supposed to be closed .
before the start of the storm , R@@ z@@ ke has gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ z@@ ke , workers started to clean up .
they abandoned the waste that tens of thousands of people had left the street in recent weeks .
non @-@ proliferation were built down and one of the appearance of writing in the border site was built .
no one wanted to talk to the goal .
Austria achieved few refugees from the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
in order by 20,000 migrants , the government was still held in the country .
for example , 1@@ 400 people wait for roughly 400 people to travel to Germany .
the traffic movement from Germany to Germany was stopped on the fire on German authorities .
regular refugees met regularly with smaller groups of refugees .

so , after Sunday , ten people were caught on Sunday &apos;s guard , as ten people were on the head of the Z@@ el@@ ts , so a serious mayor of A@@ lo@@ i &apos;s city city .

they were very grateful .
one man could not take a generous end - € 100 to the fire fire .

but the regional withdrawal was put on the line in the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high .
the bridge association with Sunday &apos;s neighbors on Sunday &apos;s neighbors , before day , was a two @-@ party race - organized by the Union of W@@ ern@@ stein and Bav@@ arians .
that Viktor Orwell is now sending thousands to us is a logical result of a sacred policy :
rather than helping the camp of R@@ z@@ ke immediately in building structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly supported the Hungarian government &apos;s stance in Nazism .
politics of these policies are not only the Austri@@ ans that are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas .
so , too , it must be found that the promised country , they are invited and welcome , is nothing more than another refugee camps .
it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee flows and the winter winter , with human @-@ rights conditions for us .
and it will be greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
on the search for 3@@ 5,000 .
indeed , there are all hands to do with refugee refugees .
more people are accustomed to his word .
the government has used the former powerful R@@ ai@@ sa@@ sen - bankers used to set up the source of refugees for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ time center of the Center has already taken control .

overall , it expects a need for 8@@ 5,000 .
to meet the number in the coming weeks , 3@@ 5,000 will have to be found - 20,000 countries are supposed to provide 15,000 countries .
if more refugees are displaced , we can create it .
it is no barrel ; it is no barrel .
he has already led talks with the country .
they would have promised to create even more refugees for the coming refugees .

this is not needed now , because they are not under the absence of these measures , the mayor of Klaus ( Klaus ) says .
but , for an emergency , emergency sites are supposed to be tested on their do@@ des .

in a longer telephone with the Prime Minister Hor@@ st Sea ( CSU ) , Joseph P@@ inger ( the country ) , Joseph P@@ inger ) , is calling for further action in the refugee issue .
he has insured me that Germany &apos;s borders are not restricted .
the flow of refugees into the Federal Republic remains possible .
but there is now the appropriate border controls .
special deductions with refugees after Germany will no longer give it .
the protective system would , however , be brought to Germany .
from other EU member states , P@@ inger called for more solidarity in the refugee issue .
that Austria is now on its limits , as well as its borders , is a logical consequence , as a result of the Germans .

it is easy to help over@@ weight .
the weight of loss @-@ loss surgery for more important people with 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say that it is too early to say whether more important people are living with diabetes after the weight of the weight of surgical surgery than those who do not go .
the weight of the loss - the loss of default - its operations or A@@ di@@ di@@ tas - Ch@@ di@@ gy , use various methods to reduce the size of the master .
they reduce hunger and limit the ability to absorb food .
B@@ M@@ I , a certain degree of weight in size , is as normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a M@@ M@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I apply more than 30 .
they can calculate your B@@ M@@ I : 1,@@ 1,@@ a@@ go@@ v / 1@@ 0@@ D@@ q@@ v .
the average B@@ M@@ I , under that operation , fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 until the end of this year .
meanwhile , in the M@@ M@@ I , the M@@ M@@ I were given to those who are not the result -
among those who are subjected to surgery , 36 % of diabetes - the disease disease , and 28 % in part .
in medical , the group treated diabetes only with diabetes entirely at one % , and in part with only two % .
researchers also monitored the patients - the &quot; blood mirror of Mo@@ mo@@ mo@@ c , in A@@ 1@@ A@@ a@@ c , that reflects the blood levels of blood over time .
, in A@@ a@@ c , the world is best held under 7 % , the researchers write .
according to the operation , the average population fell from 1@@ 9 % at roughly 9 % to around 6 % .
medical treatments - however , remained stable at around 8 % .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of ch@@ ge@@ on .
in the Swedish study , it was a study among people who are subjected to an A@@ di@@ tas - surgery , roughly 29 % less likely to die over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for the survival of the risk @-@ sharing study , Blackstone said that it is reassuring for individuals with a B@@ M@@ I who are interested in the process .
this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in these low B@@ B@@ I - a group lower , without heightened risk of death or a kidney disease , said it .
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we wait for too long until we get people to take this seriously , they said .
I think that once they have the genetic changes that their bodies are linked with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #

my child could have been lethal for my child .
Lopez Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use coal @-@ free products or disin@@ infections to use infectious infections outside the reach of the child &apos;s reach .
with alcohol poisoned , some infectious diseases were associated with deaths .

this is the business game that you want to play this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , he now wants every team to play his kind of football - not each team has two players such as the leader and Ben Ben Bernanke , so that they can play them .

J@@ V@@ A Berlin - A square square cell , five square square cell are human rights .
the federal Constitutional Court has been a ex @-@ term - the detainee of the judicial rule of law , which was a small cell in a small cell .
because of their human dignity , detainees have fundamentally claims to financial compensation if they are in small cells .
this has decided the federal court &apos;s Constitutional Court in a court .
indeed , the judges can even hope for money if they were jailed only few days of close R@@ a@@ z ( 1 B@@ v@@ R ) .
after that , the man who has now returned to a larger cell , who has come to foot , was built into a larger cell .
he did not fail to do so because of the reckless liability conditions against Berlin .
but the constitutional judge gave back the verdict of the Court of Berlin , and had the case for renewed scrutiny .
they view the man &apos;s dignity .
court court now
even if there are only a few days of liability for legal grounds for the time period , it was said that it was strong , it was said .
otherwise , it would be a fear of protecting the personality of the personality .
the court court must now address the size of money .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of criminal rights in the past .
so they spoke only in April in April , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
human rights , according to a decision in 2011 , is also , according to a multi @-@ polar decision , one of a cell without a separate cell .
in addition , it also confirmed the fall of the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had adopted a detainee in November 2009 , in November 2009 .
the plaintiffs , then , was the day between 15 @-@ 21 hours between 15 @-@ 21 hours in an equal cell as in Kar@@ l@@ ward .
the Berlin prisons have had the headlines in recent weeks as well because of lack of staff .
thus , prisoners are increasingly included in 23 hours , including aggressi@@ veness , even too , to be able to have the situation .
in the aftermath of the Justice of Justice , 21 jobs are not occupied because they are not occupied because 19 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy are : we create us ; we create this . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
migration from refugees is a huge challenge - Germany is determined to address them .
what comes to Germany ?
roughly 800 asylum seekers are likely to come after Germany this year after the statement of President Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees in Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated the challenge of the unusual determination : I say again and again : we can create this , and we can create this .
what Germany faces is the following survey .
they are needed for different forecasts between the 3@@ 3@@ 0@@ ( federal ministry ) and $ 0@@ ( P@@ est@@ el ) housing per year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as built .
dramatically , the lack of housing , especially with affordable housing , is falling annually to 800,000 @-@ 80@@ social homes from the low @-@ cost peg , and these particularly favorable homes will also compete for refugees .
federal Secretary of Defense a H@@ ri@@ a ( Social Democrats ) , therefore , wants to double , currently $ 5@@ 18 million to € 18 billion .
too little is that of the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s view : 80 million social homes would have to emerge per year , and it would have to invest $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the scientist and federal minister , then , is that there must be more tax advantages for investment in housing .
according to the estimates of the Institute for labor @-@ market and professional research , 55 % of the long @-@ term Germany can be observed in Germany .
but Germany &apos;s refugees would not systematically help them to help them .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the value of the p@@ p@@ y society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says human scientists .
in Germany , there has been a political turnaround according to the throne : from the ban on refugees to work for work .
during the past five years , an ban on asylum seekers was reduced to three months , as was reduced in November 2014 , as well as Re@@ z@@ z@@ ine , asylum seekers .
in society , too , because of the expert network , the view is that refugees should be allowed to make access to the labor market faster .
a big hurdle to the labor market access is missing .
so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and @-@ based language @-@ based language .
research also shows that jobs are most common by personal contacts .
building networks , therefore , is the wisdom of the royal family &apos;s throne .
yet the family is distributed in different languages by the family &apos;s benefits .
if the need for refugees rise sharply by the number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more professional schools .
in countries , students will be prepared for students in the absence of what they are prepared to do so .
but they are not always taught by full teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , including teachers , who only have a language in English .
there is no shortage of them , says the fall of the Berlin administration .
the German student works estimates that about 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country has banned asylum seekers or study - the only exception so far was Berlin , interior @-@ Frank Hen@@ st ( CDU ) , but has now abandoned his stance .
refugees could make access to high school access to high school .
for refugees , or consent , do not get services from the asylum @-@ seekers law , if they begin to study a study .
the latter are basically no b@@ ast@@ g , because they do not fall under the circle of people .
patient refugees had had lived to have lived in Germany for four years - to be justified - from January 1 , 2016 , in January 1 , 2016 , this range of 15 months .
but , too , this financing gap must be closed .
students should be given immediately .
Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
the state should give Islam the same rights to the same rights as they have churches , and the existing state - the policy of churches - the right to a new state - the new religions - will continue to develop .
it is also important to the establishment of an Islamic welfare one , who is professional for re @-@ education .
the right includes duties .
for example , Islam officials must agree on a clear partner , and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him certain control options .
this includes a willingness to engage in religious fundamentalism .
the leader of the Muslims of A@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ k , A@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ k of Ma@@ z@@ k , said at the former day , the worry , religious conflicts , could also bear Germany into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have been right ; they are right here , in Germany , Germany , said , he said , he said .
he proposed to put the Basic Law on Arab .
integration is far more than an issue of all society today .
this will need to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discriminatory and universal law for a scarce decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the N@@ U U - the assassination of the assassination of the police and authorities systematically ignored the racial motive in the police and authorities .
generally , Germany is able to provide the expected refugees to provide displaced refugees so far , President Frank ultra @-@ rich .
&amp; # 160 ; What &apos;s - power and capacity - we create the world &apos;s capacity , he said .
but additional money must be flowing .
to avoid bottlenecks in order to avoid shortages , it calls for an om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ ery to announce all of the most equal to all of them .
services could later be expected with federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly questionable to see so many people with limited performance @-@ based performance .
otherwise , doctors do , above all , create language barriers .
so far , the Berlin world has been shown by the@@ the@@ a the@@ ology , migrants will be worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in medicine , as well as medical costs , demands them , it demands them .
but many refugees , even with more general medical process , would put up in the emergency emergency .
and with another diagnostic look .
for example , , for example , there was much more volatile , and the young people do not have HIV @-@ infected HIV .
with part of the other disease , German doctors are clearly clear from their training .
it is not so hard to see , or tuberculosis is not so difficult to see , and what the medical profession is concerned , perhaps by the refugees , may even be in sight .
the Syrians would have a high @-@ developed education system , many refugees are even doctors .
to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their skills , and perhaps re@@ tests .
at least half the refugees in Germany are estimated to have been ill @-@ estimated by the federal psycho@@ ber ( B@@ P@@ K ) , most suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
most vulnerable are , most vulnerable , Di@@ et@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study published in Munich published that every fifth Syrian party is traumatized in Germany .
who is at the ground of post @-@ traumatic disorder , including so @-@ called F@@ ash@@ h@@ y , not the death , heart heart , and death of death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorder , strong terror , and emotional thaw .
in order to prevent symptoms chronic , early treatment was required .
so far , only four % of the mentally sick refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
yes , ill @-@ sick asylum seekers can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , but they are mostly taking several months .
moreover , social workers , or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this is often said to be wrong .

US arsenal - captain of the United Ar@@ el Ar@@ g@@ a says that they are at stake against the game against the head of the wounded national Wil@@ b .

this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ er will certainly miss at least four of England &apos;s next four Games , and , given its history , its participation in the next summer is uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ers had ended the final season after a separate hospital , and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ election season .
one sort of injury is not threatened by injury ; it said , few said .
it is a bones that are not good .
this is no larger affair .
this was only a accident .
it was not associated with his K@@ ssi@@ y or with the injuries that he had had before .
this may be true in purely medical sight , but , as well as recognized , there is the danger of further injuries , whenever a players tried to return in the midst of the season .
it is also a bad pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ j@@ t@@ d L@@ d 23 has different diseases since his debriefing of six years ago .
he played only 65 in 65 , including 15@@ 7 Li@@ p@@ p@@ es in the last five times .
the broader picture for arsenal is that in six times since 2007 / 08 , it was one of the two Prime Minister clubs that have experienced most vulnerability .
few accept the potential of a vicious circle , but arsenal believes that improvement in the vulnerability of the last season will last .
but , when you get back from injury , you have a fragile period of time , you will strengthen your bodies and win combat forces .
it is young enough to overcome this .
I hope that his body is stabilized , I am confident that he will do it , and he will go a career from the kind that he deserves .

long @-@ term lines : the Com@@ ur@@ es show that we are given serious lessons about human @-@ friendly shortcomings .
in 2013 , the most important cause of men at age was 20 @-@ 45 from 20 to 45 , and it remains three times more often than women in women .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to address this challenge .
for those who are not depressive , a circle of mentally healthy friends are the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , one must even have friends to work .
in the age of social media , with its focus on substance , the in@@ predictability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life has the need for strong , living , and successful , even if reality is dominated by isolation .
this superficial success dominates what psychologists call .
and , as a video game - the invent@@ ors and billionaire recently declared , money can &apos;t buy happiness .
the beauty of this was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
men who face us are often unable to speak with friends .
the old figure of speech , I am right , has a huge effect that it is perceived as a weakness when it is open to problems .
this is one of what I make in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term mechanisms more long @-@ term mechanisms .
they clearly presented the small moments of shortcomings .
so much of my objective outsiders - the status of the phone may help people look at despair in despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you do not attend the Central Com@@ ti@@ est deadline to celebrate the day , so why don &apos;t you take your friends with your friends at a day in the Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you are to sit on your own , you are paying a smile , and you tell him .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .

his language , with color@@ ful and imagin@@ ative forms , has received 75 @-@ year @-@ of @-@ arrest , but what does not mean that it is . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
on the contrary , the issues adapted to each issues can well be bleak .
around three years , Ot@@ mar A@@ mar has worked in his Bi@@ ble project - for which he worked a moral choice - the arti@@ stic selection of the many issues of the book of all books . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
there are cycles of cycles , such as a crusade , P@@ therland , or Fa@@ therland .
he was spontane@@ ously fascinated by the same partner : this is true for the time - his theological orientation , as well as the K@@ ob@@ ler &apos;s - was his focus on the art of art .
and , above all , the author Klaus Al@@ al@@ age , which has put itself apart on the basis of Mal@@ esy , is particularly apart .
he was interpreted by Ot@@ mar A@@ mar beer , interpreted as well as so , in the current context ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
these texts are like the mirror mirror of Al@@ de Mal@@ esy .
in fact , it is between the original slogan - O@@ z@@ z@@ at Martin Luther Martin Martin , and each type of artists who put his own personal thinking to the situation .
there is golden L@@ et@@ y .
as a result , the 75 @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day policy is roughly twice a deep glimpse in his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of instability .
moreover , education happened times with the Ro@@ est@@ y . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
I have tried to work up to me , perhaps again with the father of his father .
his second concern is to restore the art of rapid time : The perception of car@@ ri@@ ling is shaped today , and that is what it is .
symbolism .
artists have another stomach and W@@ on@@ ne to show things .
images always have something useful , and are not universal .
here , I am a d@@ inosa@@ ur .
old have not been happy to grasp the Bi@@ ble , but for him , too , for it .

for Hans M@@ ler &apos;s masters , the work of this work was an invitation , to deepen his lives and find freedom .

construction start for M@@ X X - the road
plans to be found in plans , companies are found to be set for a ro@@ p rate : a year later , almost all - but the official opening of M@@ X X - was already back again .
failures in politics and administration were fired , especially in the An@@ des , who did not tolerate the way .
so , on top of the top , there is now a new place - with formal planning and request for construction .
approval would take October in October , the first community of Mo@@ se@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ se@@ b@@ ine , the Bo@@ ck , now in the child and youth committee .
I hope that this year is even more visible that this year has happened ; they said .
then there should be no more _UNK &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
D@@ B B increased commitment to refugees
the D@@ B is increasing his commitment to refugees by 20@@ 19 , the federal League is a clear sign of a clear sign .
football reacted to the looming situation in Germany and the policy of policy to address the problems of the problem .
I wonder , I think that our country &apos;s biggest challenge has been since reunification . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
but , in principle , no one can say no one , I do nothing to do so .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 9 Angela Merkel on September 23 , he wants to discuss the collapse of Germany .
for me , I am next . I am the next time in office , the State minister , E@@ zo@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ z , and the German Chancellor .
moreover , the issue will certainly play a central role ; he announced .
football could and want to help football .
but the decisive wheat must ask politics .
German football , then , has its party initiative , which is 1 &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
some federal people also support this program .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
H@@ he@@ b &apos;s director spoke of a prominent sign of the League . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
for the E@@ M , the &quot; skill game against Hungary , &quot; the national team &apos;s national team invites 100 refugees to everyone / Sa@@ als .
I call the support of refugees as a result of a great community of German football .
that all 36 36 in their places would have launched their own projects is great .
it is as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message is 1 &amp; # 160 ; 1 : zero for a Wil@@ als that we spent are living in football .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
in this year and next year , the Association is available together with the D@@ B B - the choice of the federal government and the federal government to integrate refugees into the integration of refugees .

reports : S@@ AP .
the board of Europe &apos;s largest software - the company , Bill Mc@@ Mc@@ Der@@ t , has reportedly lost the left &apos;s left in early July .
but Mc@@ Mc@@ &apos;s motor can be given to his work .
for the beginning of October , we will meet us before the regulators in W@@ all W@@ all , he said , he said .
the 54 years old managers are at the meeting of the meeting and are fully working . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
Mc@@ Der@@ t announced in an interview with the South German newspaper ( D@@ ag@@ ing ) , he will return to Germany in October , and continue to lead to software .
I am , I am full for S@@ AP , with my job .
self @-@ understandable , I was understandable , with the full contact with the executive council , and his chairman , as chairman , told him , said Mc@@ Mc@@ Mc@@ &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
Mc@@ Mc@@ Y@@ t is usually settled between Germany and the US since the summer , but he was no longer in the German S@@ AP - the central bank in W@@ all whales .
it is important to take such a personal history with the public &apos;s managers . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
it is important to be restored again , if you have fallen . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
Mc@@ L@@ ars &amp; # 45 ;
Mag@@ n@@ us@@ ens told the same and declared that he had suffered the injury when he fell from R@@ ad .
thus , in Singapore , he is just as little a reserve pool in Singapore , as it is for the two tribal ones , and , as a week later , the Great Al@@ on@@ on , such as a week later at the Great price of Japan .
football : B@@ B@@ B B without Re@@ u@@ us against force : wheat in the goal
at the village village , all hopes for a comeback of Mar@@ co Re@@ us in the first group of the European League are finally shattered .
the national players will lack the head of the head of football - the Federal Reserve , too , is missing in the F@@ K , with the F@@ K D@@ am D@@ am ( 19@@ 00 / sk@@ y ) .
unfortunately , we can &apos;t use it ; we said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el .
given the high burden of his professor , Tu@@ ch@@ el will change its el@@ el@@ 11 not only on Re@@ us &apos;s position .
so he announced a change in the folly of folly .
as a result , novel wheat land is a novel guarantee of a novel guarantee .
E@@ r &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
but whether in the future in all Europe - the European League - has been used to use the Games , however , Tu@@ ch@@ el has kept Tu@@ ch@@ el open .
he will also deny the second slogan .
I think that we have a good chance of turning off the title . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
black cars : the government wants the way to Germany
Germany , after the government &apos;s will to change the federal government , is at the forefront of technological change .
the Federal Reserve decided to join the home of Alexander D@@ ob@@ dt ( CSU ) , including investment in the development of digital infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ dt spoke at the verge of the automobile at the verge of the automobile on the verge of a new Mo@@ bi@@ bi@@ es . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
the automatic and interconnected bicy@@ cle will raise traffic security and make fewer , said , D@@ ob@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with its counterparts from the G @-@ 7 states that meet the IA@@ A .
the United States &apos;s Strategic Department &apos;s strategy , including the importance of the mobile broad@@ band , is putting up , and a rapid shift in digital H@@ amp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
the new technology is currently being tested at the test of 9 @-@ 9 9 .
for the bicy@@ cle , he does not become the additional risk risks ; the federal government wants the legal environment , and where necessary to adapt to new developments .
for example , Germany wants to use the international high @-@ speed speed of self @-@ inflicted cars from 10 to 130 hours .
the federal government also wants to use a change in the Vienna agreement , which so far provides only people as bicy@@ cle .
with automatic bicy@@ cle , the car will become more , more and more .
technology is based mainly on sens@@ ors and cameras that address the environment and feed the data in hours .
according to an economic study conducted by the Economic Ministry , highly automatic bicy@@ cle will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , bad vehicles are expected to be on the streets of the streets ; only after 2020 are expected . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
the added value @-@ added systems , and the highly automatic functions of the location of Germany , estimate the authors &quot; authors of 2025 around 8.@@ 4 billion .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
the question of liability , and the safety of the personal data , must be clearly resolved .
but the Germans are still skeptical of self @-@ confident cars - much more than French or Americans .
in France , 21 % of respondents in 2025 , by 2025 , is 33 % in the US .
in fact , he is not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ defeating driver in Germany .
after a survey of the co@@ al@@ om , only seven % would agree to give control over all roads throughout the streets .
in the highway , the movement could imagine 15 % , at all 45 % , at 45 % .
well , every car would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bolshevi@@ l tells us - and a double start in the Ti@@ th@@ M - the E@@ M M
after all , they want to fight back on the front @-@ page front @-@ up struggle from September 4 until October 4 .
the final decision is to fall on September 22 .
it is a huge loss of loss for our team .

in fact , he was by contrast , for me , a exhibition was a bit after death , he said , he said .
when you die , you are the museum .
the impressive measures had been made in Canadian Montreal and Paris .
it is so far more than a fine clothes .
it is about tolerance , acceptance , and the vision of an open society .
there is hardly a glimpse of the even @-@ sighted work of the man who written the fashion history without ever having an education .

as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he has attracted his T@@ ed@@ dy B@@ dy , and K@@ ed@@ s , he said .
with a puzzle , his parents would not have allowed him .
that , then , has brought him back to themselves .
he looked forward in fashion , and the charges of other debriefing saw he told he in Munich .
