8 poll numbers show that Donald Donald is taken seriously .
some have tried to fire him as a fl@@ op .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
some wait for collapse .
but , no matter how some Republicans try to do so at the top of the top polls , it does not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Donald a double @-@ digit issue , and some begin to wonder seriously what it means for the chance of the nomination of real estate - a party of Mo@@ gh@@ al .
of course , it is too early in the electoral term .
no one claims that a Republican nomination is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 , Rick P@@ ay leadership was fired on the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which won only a state in the nomin@@ ating process .
and there are many reasons why he would have struggled in a general election .
but outsider groups like Bush &apos;s super @-@ PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Club for Growth is now recognizing their wealth and start throwing their dollar to topple him .
here are some recent poll numbers that indicate that real estate - a single @-@ estate regime - is not only a temporary phase :
popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Secretary announced his candidacy in mid @-@ June , a poll of the mon@@ ast@@ al University - the University of only two ten Republicans in real estate Republicans - showed a positive Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % were 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Donald .
about three of ten say that they disagree .
and these numbers hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ pi@@ ni@@ ac vote - a vote in the last week &apos;s vote in the last week - found that 60 % of Republicans have a good opinion .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P - G@@ O@@ P voters - voters would be happy with a candidate as candidates .
in a poll of CNN / C @-@ C last week , 67 % of Republicans said that they would be elected ; they would be &quot; enthusiastic , &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if it was nominated .
only two of 10 say that they would be angry ; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates roughly the same enthusiasm ( 43 % of them ) ; they would be enthusiastic ; more than 40 % that the same is about to say .
the next enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co is only 21 % .
on the other hand , 47 % of Republican voters say that they were dis@@ affected ; or angry ; if Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republicans don &apos;t see temper@@ ament as a problem .
the same figure is true in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of the state , where the same 52 % of Republicans think that he has a personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ e@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 % think that he did not have the personality to be effective , and almost six of 10 Independent Independent to say that his temper@@ ament is not the White House , so A@@ BC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when they put them up , Republican voters are in real terms in real terms .
if they are asked to win , who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P - O@@ nomination , say , according to a poll of CNN / C ) last week , ten that the best bet was the best bet .
this is a change since the end of July than four money in the end of July .
full disclosure : G@@ O@@ P .
at this point of last cycle , four Republican Republicans thought that the nomination would win the nomination to win only 28 % of the final candidates Mitt Romney .
nevertheless , a variety of G@@ O@@ P &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
even if Republicans turned to another candidate for another candidate , a tail@@ spin is almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to the world &apos;s leadership , while the anti @-@ an anti @-@ governmental game - the ECB &apos;s economy - is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a poll poll in the last September , a recent poll of last September , shows that there is a hypothetical leader - in the last head of the year - a return to the Indian leader - between the race and most other Republican candidates , in fact , in favor of multi @-@ party support .
he faces 13 points before Mar@@ co Ru@@ .@@ 14 points ahead , on 14 points before Mar@@ co , 15 points before Bush .
it is a head @-@ of @-@ head - a return to the ECB - a leader of the last year - the same race with T@@ ed C@@ ru@@ z .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would overtake the entrepreneurs of 19 issues in a hypothetical head - a return to the economy - a year @-@ to @-@ head of the economy .
a scarce majority of Donald Musharraf - a company &apos;s tail@@ spin - the Indian fans say that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of CB@@ S / N@@ Y@@ T service shows that only slightly more than half of voters &quot; voters are supporting to support their votes .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can really say to change opinion .
46 % said that they can open the door to other candidates .
nevertheless , the strongest competition is the strongest competition for other outsiders , the neur@@ och@@ g Car@@ son Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their opinion often are twice a tail@@ spin .
six of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with immigration in immigration .
since Donald Donald , in his campaign for two months ago , from Mexico &apos;s campaign of immigrants &quot; two months ago , it was out of immigration ; and in 2016 , the public discourse of 2016 was 2016 .
some are worried that the bas@@ tic evidence is supposed to damage the United States , which is crucial to the crucial - the Republican Party - who will keep the Republican Party away from the Republican Party .
but , according to the new A@@ BC / post @-@ month poll , the six @-@ day poll of 10 Republicans say that they are consistent with immigration issues .
so long as immigration in the spotlight is in the spotlight , it seems to do so apparently .
frustration over government has risen to new highs .
on Donald Donald and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters , especially by their maver@@ ick - an independent status .
six of 10 Republicans say in the new day @-@ day general survey of A@@ BC / Post , they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington .

a new study shows how special a square square square kilometers costs most .
of course , $ 18.@@ 70 per square kilometers of student students in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top .
the real estate system - the deputy service of En@@ gel &amp; amp ; League - has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square square square kilometers .
there are several ten thousand square kilometers of square square square square meters .
but who can afford to do .
for once , Munich is not at the top .

this comes from the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several members of the Germans Institute for nutrition research ( D@@ an E ) in Pot@@ s@@ dam .

by T@@ T@@ th , the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade area is to emerge with 800 million people .
plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration process suggest that the EU should choose the EU - and the US and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .

for the first time , the first time is a second resort .
it would allow it to speak against verdicts .
so far , the procedure agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , a one against their judgments against their judgments .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens of the old country &apos;s old leaders - a system in fairness and justice - have broken down on justice and justice .
in the long run , it wants to work according to an inter@@ national investment court .
then , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved .
the big investors , above all , demanded a large investor - a state @-@ owned state - the same arbit@@ ration process - as a major reason to be the main reasons for Europe &apos;s great opposition to T@@ T@@ le .

it produces the framework of the same framework ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;

the case of Cor@@ b@@ b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s de@@ dogs in the prime minister of Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s removal in the prime minister of the prime minister .
since his election , Cor@@ b@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s de @-@ leveraging of the Prime Minister Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s of the prime minister is expected to be expected with tension .
the new Labour Party - the leader of the head of Jer@@ A Cor@@ y@@ n - is supposed to give up the de@@ dogs of the prime minister , and for the first time in David Cameron .
de Cor@@ y@@ n will rise in order to face the first of his six issues shortly after day , with his performance likely to be likely to be likely to be explored by Labour and Labour - the majority of legislators .
he called for it , with fewer theater and more facts , on this week &apos;s weekly event .
he also said that he could jump to some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the denial will be the first parliamentary test for Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ yn@@ s &apos;s leadership , because , after his appointment as a member of the shadow of the shadow and his speech on T@@ UC , his annual meeting at work day .
if Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s decision , not the national an@@ an@@ them , has attracted attention to the national an@@ an@@ them , attention has attracted attention to itself .
a speaker of de Cor@@ y@@ n said that he would have been more respected ; and he was un@@ respected ; and he was recognized , and he recognized the heroism of the Royal Task Force in England .
according to the policy of the BBC &apos;s policies , the BBC says that political differences can be found within Labour , and , after all , Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s statements on the European Union &apos;s position and limiting profits .
as Cor@@ y@@ n , T@@ UC T@@ UC - said that Labour &apos;s Labour conference changes in order to remove the whole idea of limiting the whole idea .
de Cor@@ y@@ n will be the leader of the fifth party - David Cameron , who , David Cameron , ever since he &apos;s T@@ ory chairman - has been the leader of the last decade , over the last decade of the last decade - will stand up to parliament .
Labour , the leader who has promised another policy of policy , tells him that he did .
de Cor@@ y@@ n has said that Chancellor Angela E@@ ag@@ le , the shadow of the economy - will be represented by ministerial ministers if he fails - for example , if Cameron &apos;s Cameron is to go abroad .
he has also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he has addressed John Berlin , the speaker of the under@@ house , to discuss the problem .

pound rises by accelerating wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose to data in terms of data that show a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth in parallel , while increasing the S@@ S@@ E 100 by the goal target .
between May and July , the outcome without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same year .
this percentage has been soaring since 2009 , and raised estimates by the timing of interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1.@@ 50 5 and € 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1.@@ 30 € 7@@ 30 .

the chief of J@@ D says that higher wages jeopardize expansion .
the chief executive director of J@@ Peter Peter Cow@@ gi@@ y says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers - the return of workers - could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .

the cost could add up to J@@ D &apos;s plans of J@@ D plans , and that means that there will be less additional jobs .

it is expected that met@@ ic details of his defense strategy published on September 29 , when major traders of food , alcohol , and equipment lead to his year &apos;s foreign investors .
but analysts , like Morgan Stanley , believe that 12 months after opening up its first markets around 12 % of the food market in these two states will leave them away and take away from all actors , but mostly self @-@ employed retailers will take away .
according to a week published by this week , the analyst Tom Morgan Stanley Stanley suggests that I@@ G@@ A - individual traders could lose $ 360 million per year and metals by $ 250 million until the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di next year opened 25 branches in S@@ a and 30 in wa , opening a sales of 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
loss of food and food and food costs , and in the quantities of met@@ c@@ s high cost @-@ cost base , could cost roughly 13 million earnings from interest rates and taxes , said Ki@@ er@@ ath .
at the same time , metals lose market share in East states , mainly to Al@@ di Al@@ di and Col@@ der , although a recent poll of Ro@@ y Morgan found that I@@ G@@ A - I@@ purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .

Europe &apos;s economic crisis : Hungary &apos;s emergency .
Hungary explains the emergency emergency and maintained the southern border with Serbia on the day and held everyone who tried to stop illegal in the country , with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants .
chaos followed by the border , as hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ eland country and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
the people who fled violence have been pushed for an unknown period of land in the streets between the two countries &quot; two control points and left up .
but frustrations rose .
when a police fire over them were burned , migrants open up ; open the border ! &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
some have returned from food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it was unacceptable ; unacceptable , migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , it said I@@ vi@@ vi@@ ic D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turmoil in the post @-@ Serbian border came a day after 28 of the 28 @-@ year @-@ old nations - the former nations - an independent bloc in Brussels on a disputed meeting in Brussels .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , put his hopes on an early action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the rule of emergency in two southern regions was more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum seekers .
CB@@ S &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; ata reported that even prison inmates used to be used to build Serbia between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a substantial English and the European Union for the European Union in the last few months .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
we say it very clear : illegal border crimes is a crime .
parliament must agree on the military use of the military , which is expected to be expected next week , but reporters from the Associ@@ ated Press have seen hard @-@ armed soldiers in the border with heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs .
indeed , Bak@@ on@@ di Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s chief security adviser for Orban , said that , in trying to cross the border across the border , the authorities have already moved deeper into the country .
they come out of the fence by damaging the fence , and they are now accused of police law .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border visits with Serbia , including a seven @-@ day border with Serbia , after a train train to close borders .
some 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important Plat@@ ah@@ n - the role of Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would deny food and water until they must travel to Hungary .
choice - 2016 2016 - Hillary Clinton &apos;s head from Berlin to the national poll never hal@@ ved from the national poll differently from the national poll .
former US , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin of democratic race in the democratic race for the national nomination , but Senator Ber@@ never is different from their ground .
Clinton has now increased the support of 47 % of democratic voters ( 58 % ) ( 58 % ) ( 58 % ) , while it is second to 27 % ( by 17 % ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has not announced that he is running for the presidency , receives 15 % of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters .
more than five months prior to the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they say that candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more constant than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S S &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
Clinton holds a large margin of women and moderates , but they have diminished .
their support for men has fallen significantly , and that is not just about 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now equal .
Clinton , however , has yet a large margin of the older voters .
last month , Clinton was different from two @-@ head in liberals , but Saleh has now turned out to a 5 @-@ 5 - one @-@ party issue - a seat on this group .
about half of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some advance , and another 15 % would only support them because it is the candidate .
six % would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic .
the views are increased by those who are not supporting Clinton - only a quarter would be enthusiastic about it .
while 48 % of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters will also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
consent to dealing with problems and voting will also be cited .
because vice president raises the potential for the presidency , 57 % of the Democratic electorate &apos;s democratic voters want him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters ask voters , who would be the second choice for the party , Biden is Biden &apos;s top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters , more than half say that Biden would be different from a second election .
Biden decides not to run for the Democrats &quot; nomination , and Hillary Clinton &apos;s nomination is different , from 20 issues on the race on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five % of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election ; but it has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second one of this measuring , but the percentage that views him as the vote is up to the vote ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
nevertheless , when asked about what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about voting predictability .
like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates make good results in some important features among their party &apos;s voters .
majorities view Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden as honest and trusted and strong leadership .
Biden is best among the three candidates in honesty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty % of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice the other say that it is different ( 15 % ) , but 27 % do not believe him .
democratic voters in general , too , generally see Clinton , S@@ different , and Biden in consensus with their views .
in all these measures , about a quarter of democratic voters did not disagree differently .
but it is another story in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans now dissatisfied with their statement , while only about one @-@ third is satisfied .
public opinion was divided in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the E - I@@ mail @-@ mail - have no impact on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 % said that their opinion has deteriorated from their view .
it is mainly Republicans , more than six of 10 , say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
62 % of eligible voters do not think of an honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of eligible voters also see it as honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and , however , receive good No@@ da &apos;s leadership .
of the six @-@ cost candidates , Biden , Car@@ son , and Bush is best in honesty .
a majority is more honest than honest , but , like Car@@ son , many disagree with him .
the margin of error for the test of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to a nationwide poll behind Donald Car@@ son in the nationwide poll .
Ben Car@@ son is in the recent survey by CB@@ S / New York Times @-@ based The Times behind Donald
the two candidates now account for half of voters &quot; support in the new poll , and others lose dramatically .

this will happen if the Fed increases interest rates increase if the Fed increases interest rates increase .
interest rates will come , and homeowners will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , history provides little guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike , and lasted 86 months .
the Federal Reserve &apos;s aggressi@@ veness in interest rates is often , if not always , a factor responding to the economy and financial assets .
so the representatives of the US Federal Reserve - so strongly stressed that investors should focus not on when they begin to raise interest rates , but instead of the period needed for normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
at the end of the end , however , market participants may find that the excitement over interest rates might be exaggerated .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US .
but this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is one based on historical trends based on how some parts of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen last month , the withdrawal of interest rates can make things more volatile for a while .
once the increase is true , influence is not so dramatic .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to emerge later , and the return begins to reduce itself .
recessions are a fact of economic life , but rate hikes often promote them .
in the current case , the Fed faces some conditions that did not before , and that could accelerate a recession .
remarkable here is that GDP will be near its lowest rate hike in the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
according to Deutsche Bank , 1@@ 18 rate hikes since 1950 was only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 % .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % , few expect that this will last , and expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter of the Atlanta .
interest rate hikes in a fragile economic game may be risky , and raise the question of whether it is different , but the Deutsche Bank said this time .
market participants have made this year on the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on this week .
while many strategists and economists believe that the M@@ M@@ C could approve an increase in the meeting in this session , there are only 25 % more likely .
by contrast , this is clearly slow recovery , which was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited for the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , because the market is an interest rate hike , and the pattern is much similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , returns seem to change as soon as the first increase in the cycle .
at the end of the cycle of bond yields , the Deutsche Bank said immediately .
Charles Charles &apos;s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a flat curve .
interesting , it says that markets have already adapted to the Fed - the Fed &apos;s policy strategy - that is already adapted .
with the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations , there are some signs that the market has adjusted for the prospect of tighter monetary policy .
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , short @-@ term interest rates have grown , credit @-@ line , and credit volatility has increased , and volatility has increased - all of the market &apos;s features when the Fed exacerbates its strategy .
big and whole businesses will benefit companies that benefit much of their business activity in the US , when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse off , because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debt .
&amp; # ; &amp; # ; &amp; # ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45
firms with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after the record of interest rate hikes in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital - bond yields , and low volatility in their stocks , too , also hit their counterparts with low quality ( percentage points ) on average ( percentage points ) and 3 percentage points ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the dollar .
savers could see profits through higher returns , even if experts differ on how fast this will happen .
BBC radio 3 is a copy of C@@ las@@ sic F@@ M , according to the parliament &apos;s parliament says a member of Andrew Ver@@ gh@@ gh@@ am .
the parliament &apos;s conservatives criticized the station because of his office ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;

he was also aimed at the BBC musi@@ c A@@ wards that launched last December .

BBC , the BBC chief director , rejected the charges , and argued that BBC radio 3 far before its commercial competitors , if it is a live of life - music music and education .

early earlier this year , the BBC argued radio 3 more than Alan ey , Alan ey , who must work harder to engage in the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC - the BBC - that was found during the decision for the selection of culture , media , and sport under fire under the fire of commercial rivals on the feet .
the T@@ ory men - D@@ ami@@ en D@@ olo@@ ice - went on The Vo@@ ice - the music @-@ based son of the BBC - the BBC &apos;s show of the BBC , which was bought at an estimated cost of 22 million .

officials of A@@ I / D@@ ole
at the top of the national court , the high @-@ ranking high of two officials of the Austrian people on the Vol@@ le@@ y@@ au - T@@ le@@ ei@@ ei@@ ary , I have been able to get up to me whether they need to be left and left .
the defendants are not guilty .
one was accused of abuse of office also because of office .
of this charge , he has been spoken strongly in May .
the current process has been postponed .
according to top Robert Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el , the chief economist Robert Ri@@ ff@@ el had cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the defendants were used in 2006 @-@ 2011 money accounts for which they were used to work for private purposes .
the damage is associated with around 400,000 euros .
sports officials are also charged with financial ministers .
this fact is left out of the head of the opening apparatus , the leader of Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ que .
it should be negotiated later .
the defense of the un@@ asked was defense that no wealth was born at any time .
when we were on the situation , we were leading to the situation : do we lead the Club to keep us ?
he decided to take on this task with his colleagues and complicity .
with all risks .
&amp; nbsp ; We have failed to withdraw our life insurance as security in the bank ; he said that he said .
the agreement was agreed : they can manage money freely , which cannot be made .
wheat - if successful financial success - had been adopted in 1991 @-@ 1991 compensation .
thus , one part of a portion of compensation was later paid for years later , namely , in 2003 , when an plus was on the account .
so it seemed to be flat - and not ab@@ ail@@ ing - that the former Ob@@ mann explained .
the accounts and savings books managed together by the two defendants , the second defendants .
why payments were not laid out in detail was asked to judge .
one was not interested in the details for financial development , important as it was freedom of debt , as the answer .
when a official investigation began in 2011 , a sum of $ 1@@ 20,000 euros was over@@ stated on the account .
those who had been savings explained the defendants .
this securities account went on the name of the second defendants , and was not known according to his statement .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
the answer was long to answer .
then he believed that he believed that this is best for interrogation .
if anything had happened , no one had known something of this money , the prosecutor was in the room .
being informed , the official was justified .
this over@@ allocation was laid out when it was restored .
why do harm , and prosecutor , wanted to know why harm reduction ?
the first defendants declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the damage was never created .
but what should I do when the lawyer says : when they are wrong , they are all out of the edge .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
furthermore , the official said that he never had a cents salary , and he expects only miles of money and di@@ ves .
at the same month , he had put up a 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was far higher .
accurate documents for early years could not have been the defendants .
they were said to be judged correctly after all that they were judged correctly , after all that they were judged correctly .
miles of money had also had the second defendants .
all of the benefits are in place , he said that he had to go on his housing market in his housing market , he declared in his statement .
the main renegoti@@ ation will continue on September 23 , with the survey of witnesses .

as a result , a $ 2.7 billion cost of $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) told the company on service .
the step would lead to a special burden of roughly $ 2.7 billion , which would fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
HP was at the end of 2013 / 14 / 14 , roughly 30@@ 2,000 employees .

time about interest rates on the US Federal Reserve -
the world is watching if the US Federal Reserve - on two days , at the day and D@@ urs@@ day - comes together to meet the key decision , whether or not for almost a decade .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed has pushed interest rates to zero .
the US economy - an economy based on relatively good performance , $ trillions of dollars , will be added to balance sheet and generate little inflation .
but the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions .
it warned markets to hire an increase , but the signs suggest that the chances against such a step are good .
the decision should be known at the G @-@ .@@ m. at D@@ .@@ m. at the first day at the first day .

Lu@@ ke Sha@@ ke of Manchester United States can not play for a double correction for months , for a double correction .
Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w suffered among the champions of the Clinton League - the last League of Justice - defeat by Manchester P@@ V , S@@ V , a double correction of his right @-@ wing .
while this has put it out of the left &apos;s leftist defense and exclude him for at least six months of games , Louis G@@ van G@@ a@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
injury was caused by a reckless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno @-@ Ocampo after 20 years after 20 years of old Sha@@ w in the P@@ V - S@@ V .
he was treated nine minutes in the playing field , and needed oxygen before he was brought into hospital .
van G@@ a@@ al said : &amp; nbsp ; E@@ r , a double @-@ dip , and the hospital .
it will be tomorrow , or perhaps tomorrow , and then operates in Manchester Manchester .
it is horrible - a boy who comes with 18 too Manchester United States - it is very difficult , and then fantas@@ tic , and then it is happening .
in the re @-@ decad@@ ine , he had a oxygen from the former .
he caught up .
I am no doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ k@@ le , then six months , and he will not play in the group stage .
I hope that he can re @-@ play this season .
Moreno seemed happy to escape a Red card and the imposition of a El@@ f@@ al .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ te , the referee , has not punished Mexicans .
van G@@ a@@ al suggested that Italy &apos;s referee was wrong .
they can judge themselves if I say that a El@@ f@@ k and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack on both sides .
in fact , Manchester United has suffered the loss of Lu@@ ke Sha@@ w in the loss of P@@ ke Sha@@ w in the defeat of P@@ V Sha@@ w in the P@@ V S@@ V .
there is an additional incentive in England to recover until the next June .
Ni@@ p Co@@ , , the P@@ S@@ V , said , he said , he said : &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; It is a very bad violation .
when a player relies on this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to violate opponents .
Moreno suffered a break @-@ up when Mexico was in Mexico as a Dutch leader - the Dutch team played in 2014 in 2014 .
&quot; E@@ r is very difficult , &quot; because it did not want his intention to violate opponents , and if you hear that it is a very bad violation , it is not good , saying that code said .
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
in conversation with S@@ 9@@ 6 , I said : I know ; I know how to know how to know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about this .

to be sure , David Cameron knows better ?
it is a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child lo@@ ves a book , it will not take long until you know it .
it is perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child child@@ care - he was asked to call a single child - he chose to call a child &apos;s child , the prime minister chose The C@@ a@@ x , the environmental degradation of Dr. sea .
most likely , such a relatively low public @-@ relations company - a relative task of heroism - has been delegated to a child who has not read a child for 20 times each time .
a D@@ owning company - D@@ ar Street - was said to say that Cameron &apos;s text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s electoral system .
super@@ C@@ am confirmed that the text of Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam me was clearly threatened by the English team , but it is still difficult to do it , but it is still difficult to find it hard to do so . but it is still difficult to do so .
I would not rule out a victory .
with the ball , Mo@@ di@@ eums Ali - Bo@@ w@@ ler and A@@ di@@ l Ras@@ am , even if he is an unknown size on the test - is an option for the attack .
in the case @-@ related news : Adam L@@ th , the return of England - the victim of England - will be able to take a single leader - and will be replaced by Ale@@ x H@@ x .
it is , of course , to be difficult to analyze Adam me , of course , as his chief head in Yor@@ sh@@ ire , hard to analyze .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that krill players are directed at results .
there was no question in Joe Ro@@ ot , for example , and that led to the nomination , and , as I said , I have said that players are their own best voters .
long ago , it would have been leng@@ th@@ th over course , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopes another one hopes for another Yor@@ sh@@ ire , there is another chance .
England &apos;s support - a master good before Bav@@ aria , he praised his stance , even if he did not make good achievements , and this is not surprising ; he is especially a team of his team .
the question of how much time is a test of this test - a leader in order to sign his sign - is difficult .
n@@ th received seven opportunities - like Sam &apos;s son before him - during N@@ ick ton of nine .
only one ton of opportunity received the chance to go back and play out .
the only charge that one can rise was that England first started first in the Caribbean - but it was now in the past - but that lost opportunity is now in the past .
Ale@@ x comes in place , and he is a slogans that I have high levels .
he is a single factor - a return factor - to a return factor , which we saw as a single factor , when Yor@@ sh@@ ire came early in this season , when he stood 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bri@@ dge , which hit us very much .
he must receive at least the same opportunities as he received , but this depends on the United Arab Emirates &quot; team .
the idea to make Mo@@ mus@@ eums aside from Cook , which will go up in the case of a year - a return in the past - a single Bo@@ w@@ ler and four Qu@@ ic@@ ks would have been used , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a watch@@ man cannot beat there , and the Lin@@ k@@ anders has already shown that he is a vicious mo@@ l of cricket - an individual player .
Mo@@ eums may not be a job for his Coun@@ ty Coun@@ c@@ ire sh@@ ire , but he is a number of 3 to them , and there is no big difference .
my former team of collective justice played his first 38 tests in the first drug before he resigned in 2001 .

Z@@ af@@ s@@ ari has come to the cadres as a result - an economy up to the bottom up - and , and , in my limited handling of my limited deal with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
he will learn a lot on this way .
aside from the team , England has made a few wise supplements in the training former .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ ay@@ ers , the bat@@ sman of Sri Lanka , as advisers for the testing games , could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the best game of the game , which will bring an abundance of experience , because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul , Paul , will come for the white cow - the same time - and brings the energy and a powerful use of power .
I always felt that he has been able to compete for international cricket - competition , as players or a code , and , like Mah@@ ela , he has insights that we can benefit from .
sometimes new votes can bring new voices in fresh wind , even if the news is in accordance with the past .
in the D@@ HA@@ M , D@@ HA@@ M , Ben St@@ am , I will not be used to say for the one - I am not used to use a lawyer , and Ro@@ ot received a similar break against Australia , and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but code and team makers do not determine the timetable .
and you must think that how players depend on their findings depend on the results .
such decisions will not be made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Party &apos;s ( Bre@@ x@@ ite exit from Britain from the EU ) could win to win if the economy gets a slack by 7 to 7 to 7 .

we could also call it , and there may be a low @-@ level policy agenda .
Prime Minister and Treasury meetings in foreign ministers and meetings in foreign capitals make a graph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reform .
it is always about me .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 201@@ 7 .
he is also a declining force .
Poland may soon soon have a nationalist right @-@ wing government , Spain .
so some ministers might even plan in the S@@ x@@ y note , not entirely in the S@@ NP - and , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 201@@ 7 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process - is my friend &apos;s friend .

experts on the report of public England &apos;s report on Public E -
claims of a state @-@ funded agency for government @-@ financed cigarettes are less damaging than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 individuals , partly with links to tobacco industry .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ Y ) in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ Y ) joined the Lancet by criticizing the Public Health E ( PTAs ) in the report on the ground .
PTAs published the &quot; fundamental report , &quot; last month , and describes him as a result of a comprehensive review of evidence .
but some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal journal Lancet last month reached an extraordinarily low basis .
two other researchers write in B@@ M@@ Y , and asked whether the claims of claims on the sand are built on or build on sand .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a meeting called a firm called Euro @-@ Health Health , whose chief executive was previously asked by British American @-@ American funds ( asked ) to receive an independent study .
he also signed the credentials of public health in a public report , told them .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting , one of the three @-@ year @-@ to @-@ return cigarettes .
the reasons for the selection of the body will not be delivered , but it includes several well @-@ known E - a return of the economy - a matter of state champions , some of which are also a company - a single fund - on paper .
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how - a firm in tobacco control .
on the meeting , tobacco took part of the tobacco .
however , none of these links or restrictions in the P@@ E - Committee - is discussed .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ E &apos;s claims that there has been no evidence ; there has been no evidence that there is no more than a way to buy cigarettes - a path to smoking for children or non @-@ trust .
Pro@@ f Kevin on , director for health and well @-@ being in PTAs , said that the M@@ Y &apos;s claims was already responded before .
he said :
every second lifetime smokers die in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health @-@ care risks of the E &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
PTAs has demonstrated the clear duty of public information about what evidence demonstrates , and , above all , when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually with smoking , and smoking costs two billion per year .
by clear evidence of the current evidence that the economy - not without cigarettes - is without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking is fulfilling our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ ders , as a former leader of Ch@@ ast@@ el ,
Johnson said that the TV fee should be used only to make the kind of programs that don &apos;t end by other UK - the company station .
he criticized the BBC that they publicly criticized legal programs - which are likely to be a smaller audience , in a hard @-@ line window of time against the most popular Sho@@ s of their rivals and the elderly like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
if you don &apos;t want to keep the fee , what I believe in medium- or long term cannot be good for a good idea , one should at least be based on programs that do not make others .
they send bird ice into a top time , because they want to achieve broad support for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it is ridiculous , of course nonsense .
Johnson said : I don &apos;t see why a re@@ gressive tax financed by subsidies could be financed without subsidies .
the bird is such a program , E@@ ast@@ ders , and another , admittedly , are both productive .
frankly , other channels would give right to their right .
I am asked to see how to see this publicly - and publicly @-@ owned TV .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC at all .
they lay in a window of time that no one wanted to see .
on the report , Johnson said the committee : I am calling for you to find a more re@@ gressive system in terms of conditions that can be given the best value .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;
the video shows how to change the gap in the direction of the moment in which they will be punished with K@@ lan@@ gi@@ sen .
scientists have created worms with genetically changed nervous systems , which can be controlled by waves of waves .
the tiny heat line change in the direction of the moment in which they are being heard with a human hearing to be too high a friend to be heard .
the stimulus is working through the intimidation of the old engines of Eurasian cells - which will be genetically changed to contribute to the M@@ n M@@ n - the same channels that respond to anti @-@ market waves .
another issue : researchers read and write brain activity with light .
F@@ ok@@ worms usually respond not to ultra @-@ Ul@@ as@@ ani , but C@@ hal@@ ani said that they did when surrounded by a liquid micro@@ air bubbles .
bubbles , he found out , reinforce the anti @-@ market waves that enter into the worms .
the increased anti @-@ market waves have been based on structures , the TR@@ P ( IC@@ 4 ) .
the waves do make up the opening of these I@@ out channels and activ@@ ate the cells that they are allocated to them , as a report in Nature .
in order to create an anti @-@ market environment , C@@ hal@@ ani , C@@ hal@@ ani , changed genetically , so genetically that some of its engines of your TR@@ TR@@ P .
if he uses ultra @-@ change in the changing cre@@ gue , the waves of micro @-@ waves are reinforced and transferred into the worms , where they changed the old engines .
the process has some similarities with options , a ground@@ breaking To@@ ol that allows scientists to eliminate neurons with lights - and eliminate the lights .
but C@@ hal@@ ani said that it could have some advantages against this technique .
other applications could be focused on f@@ lexing cells and In@@ su@@ lin - and he added .

housing houses for refugees ,
the real @-@ estate entrepreneurs of Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner is building up in the medium @-@ size of the medium @-@ term death houses of people who do not have much money .
so , for example , for refugees , as well as a signal : non @-@ refugees need not only refugees , but just as a single mother and low @-@ income earners .

thousands of refugees are pushing for the housing market .
the entrepreneurs of Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner believes how fast @-@ favorable housing can be created : he is building in a project for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ d@@ ner , many refugees , will push for the housing market .
what solution ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner : mass defaults or to@@ ons have no sustainability .
for people remain a large part of this .
in the face of refugees , we also need enough homes in the next few decades .
a very common , three @-@ fold friction , is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : a rice gap needs least in place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you fail to derail people in housing .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project is composed of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each housing unit has two bed@@ room room , bad bad room , a kit@@ che , and a supply area .
it can be said that many refugees will say , it is peace to return to peace .
then the houses can easily be built into their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : the price for 160 square square square kilometers per house per home is at 18@@ 4 euros without land .
this is manageable .
six months of construction took place .
this is appropriate .
have construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : building my project correctly learned my project .
it makes it particularly complicated that the looming dam is the threat of special construction and the specter of bursting order .

there will always be at least three good centers .

Gil@@ d@@ ner , which was accused of creating luxury seekers for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not exacerbate competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : we have had a construction boom in the last five years : but we were built on luxury homes that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , and ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees , but just as single mother or low @-@ income earners .

in the form of ex @-@ government - the result of an increase in finance , monetary prospects for 2016 - the real outlook for 2016 was reduced to 2016 .
F@@ ed@@ al reports reported disappointing results for the last quarter , and the favorite of the ECB - a giant giant cut its profit year for a year because of weaker demand for the services services and higher cost of its transport service .
the firm also plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 Sa@@ is@@ o workers for vacations .

F@@ ed@@ Cor@@ cor@@ p@@ --@@ said to gain from 1@@ 0.@@ 40 $ 1@@ 40 - and 1@@ $ 0.@@ 90 in the business year that ends in next May , less than in the previous forecast .
analysts expected from $ 1@@ 0.@@ 84 to $ 1@@ 84 .
the lower prospect comes despite price increases , average 4.@@ 9 % , and on January 4 , January 4 , and , despite higher risk strikes , severe and large stimulus packages , which will be raised by November .
the company said that the outcome was expected to increase last year because of the cost of cutting , higher revenues , and for growth in online .
chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company can yield solid returns if one is weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade .
plans for the holiday ( U@@ PS ) were later announced than the rivals of U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example , the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on August 31 , $ 6@@ 92 million , more than $ 6@@ 92 million in August 31 , more than $ 6@@ 92 million last year .
as a result , the stock market amounted to 2.@@ 42 per stock , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per stock , the twelve @-@ year Z@@ ad Investment Research Research .

in recent years , in the past few years , there has been a decline in the international leadership of the economy - and that has made it stagnate in the unity of its unity .
but the boom in online .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 % in sport , but the operational result was essentially flat for higher cost of greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Euro @-@ based entity - more than higher revenues , owing to higher prices , as the result of higher labor costs .

at the end of them , at an end to the end of the dual customs process , an image of the United States is underway .
the card is a reminder that the Fed , the leader of Jan@@ et L@@ et L@@ et , and her colleagues should put all things on the economic interests of the nation .
the central bank has a dual mandate from Congress : maximizing US officials - the same employment and prices here .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed recognized that there is a unwritten mandate : financial stability .
but , when I think that they were a pretext to raise the interest rate , increased uncertainty about the global market to continue to wait for the global market is enough to wait for them .
there is no consensus about what the Fed will do about what itself is worrying about the financial market .
about half of economists who recently asked Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week .
but financial markets expect the Fed to wait , with a key Indian indicator showing only a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the phrase , unless it promises to mitigate the blow by promising them to promise further increases .
on the service &apos;s service , the Dow averaged 2@@ 8.@@ 89 , or 2@@ 8.@@ 1.4 % by 16@@ 1.4 % in 16@@ .@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed - the Fed &apos;s policy line in this week , said John London , chief economist Moody &amp; amp ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point ; he said he said .
if it does , it would have to go out in its statement to calm financial markets in order to calm them into panic .
other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month ago , the Fed seemed on good ways to raise the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in the slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ e had told the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed , this year would expect to rise .
although job creation slowed in August , improving labor market improvement was solid this year .
unemployment fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the Lev@@ el that the Fed sees as full employment .
wage gains have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation was constantly at the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said that the Fed - representatives of the Fed - said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy can manage higher interest rates , and needs higher interest rates on the labor market , which said to be I@@ d@@ son , chief economist in g@@ lit@@ on .
but financial markets around the world ended last month last month after China devalued its currency .
in May , the Dow Dow fell 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slowdown in China would reduce global growth .
the market has recovered this month , with the Dow now almost 10 % below May .
for the Fed - the Fed &apos;s representatives - market turmoil influence the complex calculations when you raise interest rates .
now he says that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better .
the health of the global economy is none of the Fed &apos;s main concern , so it should not be included technically in their decision @-@ making .
but the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then @-@ then @-@ Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could get its monetary expansion .
their decision @-@ making is that the art of more art than science , said , said Z@@ ach@@ ary , the head of the global strategy for the company &apos;s asset management of IN@@ C .
L@@ z@@ er , rightly member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Open Market Committee , opted for an interest rate hike in 1998 / 1999 .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , despite limited impact on growth in the US , despite limited effect on growth .
a year later , the Fed - the Fed - made these representatives reversed .
the Fed should put stability aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis , like the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Po@@ sen , a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England .
recent turbulence does not come near this level , he said .
you don &apos;t want to get out of situation ; you certainly want to get a situation in which they are afraid of an interest rate , because markets went up ; said , po@@ po@@ ses , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act is still the double mandate , and does not mention financial stability , and until that , I don &apos;t believe that it should be predicted time .

but a decision on the board of the Governing Council , and the t@@ t@@ k at the next day , 23 September 23 .
if plans should be implemented , all of the barely 50 staff would go on the hospital .
the overwhelming majority should move with Fischer and the further existing domestic con@@ ges@@ ation after Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the R@@ aces are there .
workers who cannot do so with Sch@@ ong@@ au is supposed to be offered to a job in the workplace , as Jo@@ l@@ v , Jo@@ er .

the change triggered by Dr. Andre@@ as Andrei E@@ as , which has been the beginning of the annual director of the Sch@@ ong@@ ong@@ clinic clinic , now shifting private practice to a more immediate proximity to the hospital .

there was no real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working for more than 30 years .

while super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field in P@@ per@@ au ( land wi@@ wi@@ berg ) , several J@@ aces were involved in using the police .
after a Sch@@ op , a 6@@ 3@@ 3@@ 3@@ 3@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ - @-@ year @-@ old man - took severe injuries and hospitals were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear .
criminal police identified .
16 .
one suspect , one suspect , has led the police in Satur@@ day , which has led the missing 16 years - the Rhin@@ eland of the Rhin@@ eland .
in the interrogation of the 20 @-@ fold , the G @-@ 20 leaders have been killed , killed youth , and have thrown their ser@@ es into a rock .
one since Satur@@ day &apos;s Satur@@ day , 16 @-@ year @-@ old men - the Rhin@@ eland country - have fallen victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s suffering was found at night at night in the Emperor at Emperor , such as prosecutors and police .
as a suspect , it is also true in the service of 20 .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old men were reported to have been reported tomorrow tomorrow , as they were agreed at home after a visit to the eve of a Her@@ en@@ sen at home .
in search of young woman , they initially met with personal counterparts of the victim .
in the name of a friend - and acquain@@ tions of the missing , after all , a reflection of the 20 @-@ year re@@ thinking of the G @-@ 20 - has emerged .
the alleged perpetrators then led the police into a channel to rock rock where the ser@@ che was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities have been reported in police police , 16 of the 16 years - and have been killed in the channel .
the 20 of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old men should be held on the n@@ oke of the port of liability , which puts him on the burden of death .
light on the foreseeable circumstances , indeed , should bring further investigations .
refugees need housing .
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more refugees are also searching for an affordable stick .
pressure on housing prices is growing .
social construction faces a challenge .
distributional battles on the German housing market have long started .
for the EU &apos;s coming refugees and working workers , the EU is pushing more people into a market that is already over@@ stretched in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens over the past affordable homes .
to cover demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built every year .
as a result , a study in the mandate of social housing is the case .
compared to this year , Germany will deal with 2@@ 60,000 units this year .
this lacks 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees are no longer obliged to live in the first three months of their refugees , when asylum seekers live in a first future .
many then run on the housing market , and cra@@ ve in the long line before Mi@@ et@@ y homes .
according to the federal office , however , the federal office was less than half of all asylum seekers in last year .
but the negative development of the housing market is not only rising refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in housing policy in recent years .
Germany
today , around 7@@ 0,000 housing units , there are already around 7@@ 0,000 units of living units , lament@@ ing Mat@@ thi@@ as Ver@@ ther , the author of the study .
many professional workers have been found in large @-@ scale cities , including the G @-@ 20 .
young adults remained un@@ constrained by the housing market for longer @-@ term housing ; M@@ ama .
in the large cities , the number of square kilometers per capita has fallen first in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance is running out of social construction ; a new start .
new incentives should revive social construction .
it could be abandoned on the green @-@ income tax , and the basic tax on housing @-@ sponsored housing could be exposed .
moreover , there are attractive tax opportunities according to an alliance .
the refugee program of the State Bank of K@@ K@@ W is already good for cities and communities .
a week after night , there was already roughly 300 million euros at night on Mon@@ day night .
now the project may even be expanded .
refugees have free freedom : Croatia and Slovenia set a free cor@@ ri@@ dor :
after Hungary , it is virtually no longer , because more refugees choose the path on Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ b vowed to provide obstacles to Slovenia &apos;s trip to Slovenia .
but it is dangerous .
Croatia , with neighboring Slovenia , wants to establish a cor@@ cor@@ dor for refugees .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; I have spoken with the interior minister , and if the interior minister is necessary , and we will organize a cor@@ ri@@ dor , said that the Croati@@ an interior minister , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ j@@ ic , said .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria , and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
the EU .
after the removal of Serbia &apos;s Serb border , hundreds of refugees have broken hundreds of refugees after Croatia to reach out to Western Europe .
500 people have come to the border with To@@ sia , reported in the television TV station R@@ T@@ L .
Hungary had its border with refugees .
new laws that joined the same day make a decent asylum process in Hungary virtually redundant .
Croatia wants to happen .
Croati@@ an Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ vi@@ c said : you can travel ; you can travel , and we prepare us for this possibility .
these people are because they are women , children , and men who live and do something .
but it is people who did not live in Croatia .
the Croati@@ an police had picked up the first refugees on the first line of Serbia &apos;s border on Serbia &apos;s border with the EU .
most media report reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with both the B@@ B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ en in the Serb border city .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to take root over the green border after Croatia .
at the same time , the anti @-@ Serbian border - and Serbian border refugees - do not fall on borders .
there are other dangers to the border : there are still sharp mines from Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
min@@ e@@ age is now quick to create a safe pas@@ age .
after Hungary , however , there is little more refugees after closing the border .
on the service , the police were 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before Mon@@ day , it was 9@@ 3@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws can overcome and eliminate the damage of borders as a criminal offense .
this is why 35 criminal proceedings were launched in the South &apos;s southern border city .
the conviction threatened to prison prison sentences for too five years , and the withdrawal from the country .
according to the immigration authority , one was re@@ aligned in the border of 94 &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
among the producers are 13 families with small children and two older people .
tomorrow , there would have stopped 40 refugees tomorrow .
but no one has a prospect to receive asylum in Hungary .
according to this view , Serbia is out of its own , secure @-@ third .
asylum seekers are supposed to be above .
on the verge of tran@@ ches ; on R@@ z@@ z@@ ke , only few hundred refugees gathered .
workers started to clean up workers .
they accumulated waste , leaving tens of thousands of thousands of people in recent weeks on the street side .
Sper@@ le was reduced , and one of the sites in the border place was built .
no one wanted to express the goal .
Austria is only few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
in order to hold 20,000 migrants , 20,000 migrants held still in the country .
in Sal@@ z@@ burg , about 1@@ 400 people wait for Germany .
train travel from Germany to Germany was stopped by the rule of German authorities .

that Viktor Orwell is now sending more thousands of us to us is a logical outcome : a hypocritical policy :
rather than helping in the camps of R@@ z@@ z@@ ke , the establishment of human structures , our Chancellor officially has officially made our Chancellor of Nazism , and publicly has publicly led to the Hungarian government &apos;s stance in Nazism .
these policies are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chaotic conditions in border areas .
also , too , they will have to discover that the &quot; promised land &quot; that they welcome and welcome is nothing more than another refugee camps .
it will be a great challenge , given continuing refugee flows and the winter of winter , with human @-@ rights conditions to be able to protect .

if more refugees should be displaced , we can create it .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
he has already led talks with the country &apos;s leaders .
they would have promised him to create even more refugees for the coming refugees .

Konrad and M@@ ai@@ ic yesterday did yesterday &apos;s standards for under@@ service . &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; #
in emergency times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ ers must comply with a certain level or size of the upper hand .
for a temporary time , emergency standards would be seen .
by contrast , the interior ministry , unlike the interior ministry , is based on his experience .
I am a older man who is not saying yet without another face .
persuasive is his most important weapon .
Konrad and M@@ ai@@ ers do not cause the cost of how they declared themselves .
their number of workers want to increase them to three to four .
it has not yet been successful .
instead , he wanted to establish an office in office on the office of the office .
but there are apparently problems with approval .
Lin@@ z calls for a better division of division calls for better division .
for the moment , no opening of urban buildings and other buildings like TIPS - and the Freedom Center and Center to recapitalize refugees - is planning the city of Lin@@ z .
this is not needed now , because those who are now able to bring these measures to those without these measures says mayors Klaus ( SGP ) .
for another emergency , they should be tested on their do@@ ves .
the city &apos;s criticism is on the division of refugees within the federal country .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
he did .
in a longer telephone with the prime minister &apos;s Prime Minister Hor@@ st Se@@ k ( CSU ) , the leader of Joseph P@@ I@@ P@@ inger ( ) , on Mon@@ day , takes up on the refugee issue in Mon@@ day .
he has reassured me that the German borders will not be eliminated .
continuing refugees in the Federal Republic remain possible .
but there are now marginal controls .
special deductions with refugees after Germany will no longer give it no longer .
but protective protection would be brought down after Germany .
by the EU &apos;s other member states , the EU &apos;s member states demanded even more increased solidarity in the refugee issue .
now that Austria is now on its limits to its limits on controls , it is a logical result ; a logical consequence of the Germans &quot; actions .
the next R@@ lic@@ ly , the next question is a matter of time , a question of time is a matter of time .

previously , several weeks earlier .
I did , but I have long complained about whether I want to open up bin Laden .
the key to the decision , among other things , was , among other things , that the specter of return - Indian producers who are at home in B@@ olo@@ gn@@ a at home - were sold by the idea of a self @-@ location where only their cell phones were sold .
&amp; # 160 ; We are the only one in the large area of Lin@@ z , who sell this brand , says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots .
their fashion of fashion - a self @-@ interest interest - has taken hold by her mother .
I know most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some woman can do so at the sight of a beautiful cell phone , nor can it be sure to be sure of recent security .
perhaps it is because there may be a beautiful pocket for each other .

the P@@ falsi@@ zer ancestors of Donald Donald came from a place whose residents are called off .
this quality also combines some of the billionaire , the US president - a president .
Donald Donald ( 69 ) is always good for a good .
whether he is xenophobic , journalists , or knowledge in international crisis politics - is revealed for the US president - the US president &apos;s election campaign .
and it is good .
this will also be registered in the older city city , where the grand@@ parents of real @-@ estate homes come from millions of people .
new Yor@@ kers in New Yor@@ kers have a fresh term in the wind .
some of the 1@@ 200 people - 1@@ 200 inhabitants - the Indian population is more related to him .
his grand@@ father came out of the city &apos;s city : Donald Donald , here , in campaign mode .
the K@@ all Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el turned a movie into a tail@@ spin .
and what do villagers think about his goal of becoming the world &apos;s most powerful man ?
I do , I believe that this is somehow exciting , but they are not deeply impressed in their st@@ ad@@ st@@ ent way , but says Sim@@ one W@@ end@@ el .
the city &apos;s K@@ inn@@ al city has an am@@ am@@ ic film on the ground and his famous sp@@ es@@ no@@ ts , which also matters , as well as the K@@ et@@ ch@@ al family , a family @-@ owned family .
he has not brought it to the king of the king .
true , there is respect to the performance of the family , but also tends to think that it is a tail@@ spin ; a bit of a great deal says that it says .
as a result of the top name of the city &apos;s city city , &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
so a tail@@ spin comes from the village &apos;s village .
the post @-@ war success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grand@@ father turned out , and in the US opened up for gold graves .
the seeds of real estate were New York in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tra@@ k : their desire to return to home , failed in Bav@@ aria &apos;s state that was at the time .
he did not work , because he was once denied approval , the director of the Institute for older history and popular dogs , R@@ ol@@ and Paul , to explain the film .
a tail@@ spin is the grandchildren of an illegal immigrant .
this stands in contrast to what is sometimes clear from the descendants .
it has repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for building a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
the Win@@ zer looks more likely to be distan@@ ced by Americans ; he is always so open .
does he believe that there is a tail@@ spin ?
I can &apos;t get out of the event ; I don &apos;t think of me , say , the 72 .

the pension system , like some K@@ ad@@ ka , mentioned like some K@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ad@@ ter that a visit to the family ended up with something good for the church , which is generally good for it .
&amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
they are better if he did not win the election , because he has such radical views ; I don &apos;t know whether this is good .
if those who had been in charge at the time of his grand@@ father in the US , he would have failed ; he would never have reached .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;

&quot; yes , &quot; a president does not , yes , says it .

for easily important di@@ e@@ cists , the weight of loss @-@ loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of loss of loss for easily important people with 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is too early to say whether easily over@@ weight people with diabetes will live longer than those who live longer , and those who don &apos;t have a return of surgical surgery .
the weight of the economy - a loss of return - and of A@@ di@@ ic surgery or A@@ di@@ tas - is used to use various methods to reduce the size of the master .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absorb food .
B@@ M@@ I , a degree of weight over size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
a B@@ M@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a M@@ I more than 30 .
they can calculate your B@@ M@@ I : 1,@@ us@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the average B@@ M@@ I , under which this operation fell from 31 , fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 until the end of this year .
meanwhile , the B@@ M@@ I remained , in the meantime , the B@@ M@@ I ( M@@ I ) , for those who did not go up -
among those who subjected to surgical surgery , 36 % of diabetes - in part , or 28 % - triggered a disease .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the same group in comparison triggered only one % of diabetes by only one % of diabetes , and partly only about two % .
researchers also monitored the patients - the same blood mirror of art in A@@ mo@@ c - that reflects blood values over time .
the world &apos;s leader in A@@ mo@@ c is best kept below 7 % , the researchers are writing .
according to the operation , the average empire fell to roughly 1@@ 9 % from 9 % to roughly 6 % .
in medical therapy , however , this group remained stable , for about 8 % .
the research team also compared to the average results in two types of ch@@ ge@@ on .
in Sweden &apos;s study , it was among people who have been subjected to an anti @-@ dumping operation , about 29 % less likely over 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the ge@@ gy of men - a patient , Blackstone , Blackstone said that it was reassuring for individuals with a B@@ M@@ I M@@ I who are interested in the process .
this study , because of this study , says that this operation in this low B@@ M@@ M@@ I , a low @-@ income group , is lower , with no lower risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take weight seriously as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
I think that we wait for too long until we get people to take this seriously .
I think that once these genetic changes have raised their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reversal is really difficult .

ultimately , we must think about how to reduce killing in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; The use of violence has never solved these problems ; added to it .
the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and raised George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 th , and turned out that the violent response of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events .

children are increasingly common to these products ; and , unfortunately , a percentage of them go out of emergency stock , said Lopez CNN said .

it could have been deadly for my child .
Lopez Obrador has recommended parents and teachers recommended to use coal @-@ free products or disin@@ fec@@ ts to use infectious infections outside the reach of the child .
for alcohol , some disin@@ fec@@ t@@ ants were also associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in on@@ t@@ ine women , following the incidence of infectious infections that were toxic , not toxic allocations .

Peter Moody argues , Peter ste@@ wards , tried to eliminate him and threatens to end the renminbi &apos;s sport to end sport
Peter Moody claims that , in order to end it , he has tried to stop a spy in the past year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he had kept himself back 18 months of espionage .
I did nothing ; I had nothing to say , and I have had a long time to eat , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything emerges , said Moody said .
they know that it went on .
sometimes you respond , and you must live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home today and sleep well today .
I want to go away , and I want my owners to think that I try my best to try .
if they begin to think that I don &apos;t do this , I should not be more wise .
I must think about what I know with my license .
before before , Moody had had a bomb in an interview with c@@ c@@ ing@@ .com that the return of the ECB &apos;s integration regime was trying to carry its out of all its aspirations .
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ er .
if that is true , they should be sure about their n@@ ases because they try to make me fail .
should I believe that it is personal ?
did R@@ V@@ V@@ L behave , and perhaps people outside training blame for what the industry is doing ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think that I am .
I may have to take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and this makes me sad .
this is really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .

it is a joke .

I remember that in 2010 , George W. George was criticized as a boring team , and W@@ ay@@ ne said that he would take care of a tipping point .
but now he has a team that can play that , and we see as exciting , especially its young players at their pace .
this is the baby game that you want to play when you have a kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , he wants that everyone is playing his kind of football , not every team has two players such as a matter of Anth@@ ony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ ad , so that they can play such as they can play .
I build more confidence because they are saying that they are a bit concerned about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think about us when the big was done .
B@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game against the game has reached a higher outcome than the game of Bo against Cow@@ en .
the game &apos;s game was arguably a good game , I have not seen it , but what was the result of 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this a re@@ play ?
or are flat and no matter ?

a small shift on borders to Germany on small border access to Germany

the federal Constitutional Court has given a former Constitutional Court - the Court of Justice and judicial law that was established for months in a small cell .
in violation of their human dignity , detainees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation when they are in small cells .
this has decided the federal Constitutional Court in a high @-@ ranking decision .
after all , judges can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only few days into close trees ( B@@ 1 B@@ 27 / 14 ) .
after that , the man who has now returned to a larger cell has been moved into a larger cell .
his neglect of liability for the failure of conditions against Berlin failed .
but the constitutional judge was the verdict of the verdict of Berlin , and the case for renewed scrutiny .
they have violated the human dignity of the man .
the court court now decides about the size of compensation .
even if legal for legal reasons of compensation is essential for only a few days , compensation was said to be decisive .
otherwise , it would be impossible to get out of the rule of law .
the court court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
constitutional judges have already strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past .
they spoke only in April , just because he was imprisoned in a cell .
human rights , according to a decision in 2011 , is also the value of a cell without separate to@@ es .
Kar@@ l@@ r , moreover , also confirmed beyond the Berlin Constitutional Court , who was ruled in a parallel event in November 2009 .
then the plaintiffs were every three months every day between 15 @-@ 21 hours in an equal cell , as in the Kar@@ l@@ no case .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : we create them ; we create that .
refugees &quot; immigration is a huge challenge - Germany is determined to accept them .
what is Germany ?
roughly 800 % of asylum seekers will come after Germany &apos;s Federal Ministry of Germany in this year , according to the statement by Deputy Chancellor of Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated the unusual challenge in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again , and again : we can create that , and we can create that .
what Germany has in Germany is the following story .
what is needed is needed after between 3@@ 50 estimate ( estimate of the federal Department ) and $ 0@@ 0@@ 1 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el estimate ) - a year ) - and for five years - for the next five years .
this is nearly twice as much how to build ( 25@@ 0@@ 7 ) .
but the lack of housing is especially dramatic in the affordable mix : a year from 60@@ 0,000 to 800,000 social @-@ price homes , and for these especially favorable homes , they will compete for refugees .
federal Secretary @-@ of @-@ State H@@ ri@@ a ( Social Democrats ) , therefore , wants to double , from 5@@ 18 million to € 5@@ billion .
too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el P@@ est@@ el .
in agreement , scientists and federal ministers agree that there will also be more tax advantages for housing investment .
according to the Institute for labor @-@ market and professional research , it is believed that 55 % of the unemployed in Germany can be .
but Germany &apos;s refugees were not systematically asked for their skills to help them rose in order to help them rose in order to help them .
but , for the integration of refugees , it is essential whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the value of the absor@@ p@@ tive society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , according to a number of immigrants .
in Germany , there has been a political turnaround according to Germany , from the ban on labor refugees for credit .
while there was previously a ban on asylum seekers for too five years , this was reduced to three months in 2014 , as well as the compulsory compulsory , asylum seekers at home .
society has also prevailed in society - too , because of expertise - for a majority of the belief that refugees should be allowed to allow access to labor market access faster .
a large obstacle to labor market access is a lack of unemployment .
so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and related language @-@ related language .
research also shows that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts .
building networks , therefore , is because of the view of the royal road to labor integration .
nevertheless , to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need to increase the need for refugees should rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example , by allowing more skilled expertise .
in countries , students will be prepared to be prepared for education without health @-@ care services .
but they are not always educated and educated by teachers and teachers , but also in Berlin , as well as in Berlin , which is merely an skills .
there is no shortage of lack , say , of the Berlin administration .
Germany &apos;s student works estimates that about 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country , asylum seekers , or study - the only exception has been the sole exception of Berlin , Frank Hen@@ an ( Christian Democrats ) has now abandoned his stance .
the volunteers could be made easier for access to high school .
because refugees or refugees , or acquies@@ cence , don &apos;t receive services after asylum @-@ seekers when they begin to study .
the latter is basically no bean , because it did not fall under the circle of eligible people .
patient refugees had had had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to have lived up to the b@@ af@@ nit@@ g - in January 1 , 2016 , from January 1 , 2016 , shor@@ tening this range of 15 months .
but , too , this financing gap needs to be closed , demanding St@@ phe@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State secretary for science , and the German student works .
students should get down immediately .
Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and many are part of their identity for many .
the state should give Islam the same rights to Islam as they have churches and the existing state - the state of churches - the right right to a new state - a new state - the new religions .
it would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare person who is professional in order to address newcomers .
the right includes obligations .
for example , Islam &apos;s representatives must agree on clear partners and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give him certain options .
this includes a willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism .
the head of the Muslim Muslims &quot; Central Board , A@@ z@@ z@@ k Ma@@ z@@ k , expressed the worry about the worry about religious conflicts as well as Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany .
he proposed imposing the Basic Law on Arab Arab law .
integration will be much more than a matter of all society today .
transforming the majority society will also require reducing discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been a anti @-@ discriminatory anti @-@ discriminatory law and a universal equal law for a decade .
but it has been slow to slow how the N@@ S@@ U - S@@ U , demonstrated systematically in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
generally , Germany is capable of providing the expected medical care that the medical profession says , Frank ultra @-@ rich , S@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ;
but extra money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bottlenecks , it is calling for Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all of the dec@@ ency of health issues .
achievements could later be expected by federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly dubious to see so many people with the limited performance of performance that the asylum @-@ seekers law .
otherwise , doctors in particular make language barriers .
so far , the Berlin Institute has shown poor migrants worse than other patients .
not only clinics in clinics , even in medical practice , calls for it .
for many refugees , however , there would also be more medical tribunals in the emergency .
and with another diagnostic look .
among them , there is a far more volatile disability , and , with young youth , it is the case for HIV .
as part of the other disease , German doctors mean her training , but he says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; tuberculosis , &quot; or tuberculosis is not so hard to see ; and what is concerned about the medical game is even in view of refugees .
the Syrians would have had a advanced education system , many refugees are even doctors .
to practice , however , they must demonstrate their skills , and perhaps again audi@@ ts .
at least half of Germany &apos;s coming refugees are estimated to be ill @-@ sick ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of which suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
they are especially vulnerable , explains Di@@ et@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ K K .
a recent study of Munich Munich shows that every fifth Syrian community is traumatic in Germany .
who is mired in post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , including so so so @-@ called in the hands of so @-@ called , the death toll is not a death , heart , and death sentence .
more symptoms are sleep - and concentration disorder , strong and emotional do@@ g .
to prevent symptoms chronic is necessary to treat early treatment .
so far , only four % of the sick refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
true , ill @-@ seekers can provide a request for psycho@@ therapy , but they typically take several months .
moreover , in the social @-@ welfare workers who are mostly trained or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , they decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ judgments , say , Mun@@ z .

the opening of parliament also has been warned by claims by representatives of the opposition that they would have received death threats and warned that they have been warned about calling for Mugabe with fire .

Colonel Ar@@ el Ar@@ sh@@ a , however , is saying that , prior to the game against Wil@@ el Ar@@ sh@@ a , the game against Wil@@ el Wil@@ sh@@ a must stand behind Wil@@ el Wil@@ sh@@ a .
few have emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ a that it was only September , and unless his rehabilitation plan has come to plan , there is no reason why he cannot again play before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ er will certainly miss the next four games for England , and , given its history , its participation in the European Council of Europe is certainly uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ sh@@ ers had ended the last season after a separate season , and then returned back to his old momentum during the season season .

it is a bones that do not well .
this is no bigger affair .
this was only an accident .
it was not associated with his clothes or the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true of purely medical view , but , like few , there is also the risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return to a season in the midst of the season .
it is also an awkward pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ j@@ d L@@ L is 23 different diseases since its 23 years ago .

the broader picture for arsenal is that , in six times since 2007 / 2007 , it has been one of the two Premier League clubs who have experienced most vulnerability .
few have accepted the potential of a vicious circle , but arsenal believes that improvement in vulnerability during the last season will last .
&amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp;

in an age of social media @-@ led communication , with its focus on substance , the in@@ predictability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have the need , strong , living , and successful , as well as in isolation .
this superficial success will be dominated by what psychologists call doctr@@ in@@ ous values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of physical values - our internal yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our much deeper mental health .
and , like a video game .
the beauty of the beauty was that this focus was turned on head .
every character was defined by his work not through his work , but by his personality defined by the interaction as a friend .
men who face us are often unable to speak with friends .

Mc@@ Der@@ t is usually caught between Germany and the US , but since the summer , he was no longer in the German S@@ AP - the central bank in W@@ al@@ f .
it was important to get out of such a personal story to the public , the managers &quot; managers ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160

at the village village village , all hopes for a comeback from Mar@@ co Re@@ us have finally shattered the first group of the Europe League .
the national players will be the leader of football leader , the Federal Federal Reserve , as well as Du@@ a , with the F@@ K of the F@@ K , at the former D@@ ag ( 19@@ .@@ m. / sk@@ y ) .
but we can &apos;t get out of them ; unfortunately , Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said .
given the high burden of his professor , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only alter his position .
so he announced a change on the folly position .
as a result , a novel Wei@@ den@@ al place in the world &apos;s novel is a novel .

but , whether in Europe &apos;s future in all of Europe - the same League of Representatives - the ECB was open , but Tu@@ ch@@ el was open to Tu@@ ch@@ el .
he will likely deny the second slogan .
but I think that we have a good opportunity to take advantage of the title .
village cars : government wants the way for Germany to lead Germany .
Germany should be the leader &apos;s will after the federal government &apos;s will .
the federal state decided on the top of a Strategic Strategic Minister Alexander D@@ ob@@ dt &apos;s house ( CSU ) , including investments in infrastructure infrastructure .
D@@ ob@@ dt , on the edge on Frankfurt on the edge of the automobile , IA@@ A , on the verge of the IA@@ A A &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
automatic and interconnected drivers would raise traffic safety and less worry , said D@@ ob@@ rin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss his counterpart from the G @-@ 7 .
the Department of transport , among other things , emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ l@@ ers - a return @-@ based construction - and a rapid shift to digital phone .
testing new technology is now coming to a test on Bav@@ aria 9 in Bav@@ aria .
thus , they cannot review the additional legal risks of the federal government , and where the federal government wants to review the legal framework , where necessary to adapt to the new developments .
for example , Germany wants to be used internationally that the high @-@ speed velocity of ten @-@ hour cars will be raised on 130 hours .
the federal government also wants to change a change in Vienna agreement , so far only as bicy@@ cle .
in an automatic driver , the car is increasingly taking the lead , driving drivers more and more .
technology is based mainly on sens@@ ors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data for sec@@ hours .
according to an economic ministry released by the Ministry of Economic Department , automatic drivers on highways will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , car@@ eless vehicles on public roads can be achieved only after 2020 ; only by 2020 .
the value added in bicy@@ cle systems and highly automatic functions on the location of Germany estimate the authors of 2025 from around $ 8.@@ 4 billion .
&amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
but the question of liability and the security of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly resolved .
but Germans still view themselves skeptical cars - much more than French or Americans .
in France , 21 % of respondents expected to figure out in 2025 , 33 % in the US .
already , drivers in Germany are unwilling to rely entirely on a self @-@ sustaining driver .
after one of the commun@@ it@@ al bit@@ om , only seven % would agree to control control over all roads .
on the highway , the traffic in the fluid movement could , after all , imagine 15 % , at 45 % , at 45 % .
well , every car would leave control under no circumstances .

to counter competition from Asian space , one must find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is a tension between the most fresh ideas of debriefing and the be@@ ds who need to think most economically , say , Schmidt says .
that is why a existing design would often be easily varied to keep a consumer of consumers .
a few years ago , the textile economist K@@ ast@@ ati Re@@ eb@@ ati re@@ shuff@@ led the historic snow@@ ball .
in the process , there is some small cows .
the P@@ ick@@ a gold standard was used in Bi@@ anc@@ a H@@ anc@@ a ( H@@ ick@@ e ) , which was left out of office : it was able to start nothing with traditional P@@ ad at the top .

it also delivers in the US , Australia , and after Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in the blue and surro@@ und@@ ings of memory and memory .
as a result , I see my smuggling as a modern ambassador to the p@@ at @-@ top .

EU wants to double the mercury .
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in great pre@@ dation , and consumers want to double a much higher dose of nerve .
great fish are already heavily burdened with mercury that , on the basis of limited limits , the limits on limits can not be sold .
after doubling the limits of limits , only 1@@ 4.5 % can be bought down .
in exchange for this easing , according to the EU , the EU wants to exacerbate the limits of emissions from another 0.5 million meters at mercury per year .
Fo@@ od@@ da , however , referred to this as a trick , because , because smaller , such as Kar@@ car@@ y is mostly so low that they are already keeping the planned levels .
cutting down a small scale is therefore a per@@ p@@ ling ; a diversion that helps only the economy .
