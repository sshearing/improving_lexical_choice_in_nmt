Obama is more receptive to Netanyahu .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not unique .
the two wanted to talk about the international agreement , as well as to the region &apos;s destabilizing actions in the Middle East .
but with respect to the conflict with the Palestinians and the most debated two states - RO@@ E states - are scheduled to resolve .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been shown for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s constant settlement freeze and raises a lack of faith in the peace process .
by the Obama debacle surrounding Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has worsened .
in March , Netanyahu held a controversial speech - Congress &apos;s Congress held a disputed speech that was seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting pointing to the upcoming vote in Israel .

by the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ b took life .
a day after the upro@@ ar of the University , students and teachers , forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to create an image of what Lam@@ b was promoted .
the authors in both the State &apos;s two bodies , as well as those who knew him , helped create a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were seeking to classroom .
the police in mine , where he died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Chancellor Schmidt had a distinguished one in one of his written book in which he was the real man who held his academic lives .

at the same time , there were some inclination to problematic behaviors .
a student who praised a student , fire on space , the lam@@ b said , he seemed a bit too little , nervous , and nervous , when he was wrong with him .
a other student of other students , C@@ Ã©@@ mi , said that Lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of Ministers in 2014 .
Lam@@ b had previously had the province of State University on health grounds for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem .
by this year , he delivered only two online - for example .
recent changes in employment policies meant that the emotions that had been so hard for the lam@@ b did not guarantee him as an automatic path to a meeting that had been elected to be an elected professor .

one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charismatic , and fun .

Lam@@ b and P@@ ag@@ ler were obviously a few .
in the emergency call , I said ; I had killed my wife , but there was no one of a marriage of marriage .
they had a dog called Li@@ gh@@ an , who had lived with them in the B@@ aven@@ ent house that he lived on one another to be held in bad guys .

8 % ratings show that Donald Tusk is serious .
some have sought to be convicted of him .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republicans try to travel from the top ranks on surveys from the top on surveys ( but not yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national surveys demonstrated in double @-@ digit terms , and some begin to ask what it means for the opportunities of the nomination of real estate - &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
of course , it is too early to succeed .
no one claims that the pendulum is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts point out that this time has been raised in the run @-@ up of President Herman C@@ C@@ ain , none of which has won a government in the nomin@@ ating process .
there are many reasons why he would have a general choice .
but maver@@ ick groups like E@@ asi@@ ly Bush &apos;s C@@ PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Cooperation Club for Growth now now see their wealth wealth and begin to topple their dollar to topple him .
here are some recent public opinion polls that indicate that the real estate is not just a temporary phase :
Lee &apos;s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tusk announced his defeat in mid @-@ June , a public paper of Mon@@ t@@ mouth - Shin@@ e University - that only two @-@ thirds Republicans looked positive with the real estate of the real estate .
by mid @-@ July , 40 % was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % was 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of energy espionage .
about three ten say that they have negative negative opinion .
these numbers are in early states .
a p@@ ash@@ y hi@@ k@@ ata , a vote in Iowa last week , found that 60 % of Republicans have a good historical record .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P P - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
in a paper of London / 7 C last week , 67 % of Republicans would either be able to do so ; they would be ex@@ ner@@ ed ;
only two of 10 say they would mean ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as a tail@@ spin ( 43 % say it would be ) ; it would mean 40 % with 40 % , which is the same in a tail@@ spin . )
the next ?
Mar@@ co @-@ Baradei is 21 % with only 21 % .
on the other hand , the Republican Party &apos;s 47 % of the Republican electorate said that it was &quot; a dis@@ cont@@ a , &quot; or , if , if E@@ very Bush , the favorite of the establishment of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republicans is not a problem in temper@@ ament .
the same figure is true in the first electoral state of the nation , the Communist state , where the same 52 % of Republicans thought that he has a commander @-@ in @-@ chief figure , according to p@@ ann@@ y last week .
nevertheless , it is still 44 % that he did not have the personality to carry out effectively , and nearly six of 10 @-@ year bureaucrats say that his temper@@ ament is not the White House .
Republican voters accustomed to the idea .
when she we@@ ars their teaching , Republican voters are in real terms in real terms .
if asked who is most likely to be asked , who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P A@@ et@@ ch , according to a study from CNN and O@@ W@@ C last week , the best bet is to be the best bet .
this is a change since the timing of ten , when it was ten @-@ fold in July .

at this point at this point , ten ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win only 28 % for the final Mitt Romney .
nevertheless , the fact that a multi@@ tude of G@@ P - a multi@@ tude of O@@ P - seems plausible .
even if Republicans gather a different candidate , there is still almost every trend .
some pundits point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to a role of leadership , while the Anti @-@ Year Plan - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; called for more than a dozen other candidates .
but , at the beginning of the Mon@@ t@@ mouth that was written in early September , it shows that there is a hypothetical presidential election in a hypothetical judiciary - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp

the only candidate who follows him ?
Ben Car@@ son would then surpass the businessmen with 19 points on a hypothetical set of office - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
a narrow majority of Donald Kissinger , Ju@@ et@@ Ã­@@ e &apos;s fic@@ --@@ have said that they have formed their views .
a recent survey of S / N@@ Y@@ T G@@ es@@ day shows that only slightly more than half of the electorate &apos;s voters say that they have made their votes clear .
of course , much can be done to change , and no one really can say to change the opinion .
46 % said that it can open the door to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , the most powerful competitors in the moment of other outsiders , the neur@@ ons of neurons run by Car@@ son Car@@ son , but voters who say they have their own have been double @-@ looking .
six of 10 Republicans say that they coincide with a conundrum on immigration issues .
since then since 2001 , since then his campaign in his campaign two months ago , Mexico was making a mockery of Mexico , which called for the immigration and cru@@ x of public discourse in the public .
some worry that the bom@@ bas@@ tic talk of scandal can be made by scandal - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
but , according to the new A@@ BC / post @-@ Soviet People &apos;s paper , ten Republicans say that they coincide with socioeconomic issues on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration is underway in the light of the light , it seems to have to do so .
frustration with the government is mounting on new heights .
according to Donald Tusk and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for half the support of Republican voters , especially by their outsiders - status .
ten of 10 Republicans say in the new Mon@@ day Mon@@ day - written by A@@ BC / e - that they want a political outsider than someone with government experience .
they are also angry at Washington .

the European Commission - which allows a new commission over T@@ T@@ T@@ del Commission - has begun a new court on the T@@ T@@ del court .
in addition to def@@ using the dispute on the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement , the EU Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbit@@ er system .
the controversial private disputes between corporations and states should thus be replaced by a more transparent system that is commensurate with a much more traditional courts .

it will be a second resort for the first time .
it would allow it to commit to the verdicts .
so far , the procedural choices involved was based on arbit@@ ers , a claim to their judgments .
in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens have become aware of the old 21 @-@ first failed system - and justice in fairness and justice .
in the long run , they want to work according to a national investment court .

Europe &apos;s Northern Revolution : Hungary preclu@@ des out of emergency rule , border the border .
Hungary declared the state of emergency , vet@@ ting the southern border with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day , and maintained all who tried to do illegal in the country , all of which aim to stop the flow of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants called for a kidney , and Serbian officials responded to indignation .
the people who fled violence in a country in a country in a country in a country on the streets between the two countries &quot; two countries were built and built on it .
but frustrations mounted .
when police helicopters invented them , the migrants are making ; the border opens the border ! &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the Continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not follow his hopes for an early action by Brussels or its neighbors .

former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ dip rally in the Democratic race in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie will never win on the ground .
Clinton now has received the support of 47 % of Democratic voters ( 58 % ) , while at the second rate , with 27 % ( a 17 % increase ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet declared whether he is running for the presidency , received 15 % of the Democratic majority of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months ago , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that it is too early to say what candidates will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more attentive than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S - People &apos;s Press News Corporation - Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while some different profits have been made .
Clinton holds a big margin in women and moderates , but they have reduced the down@@ stream .
her support for men with men has fallen sharply , and there is only 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now at the same point .
Clinton , however , has a big margin among the elderly .
last month , Clinton was at a different margin in the liberals , but no one has now been a 5 @-@ 5 @-@ year presidential election , at the start of this group .
for example , half of the Democratic electorates of the prim@@ aries tell me that they would support them with enthusiasm if they nominated the Party .
a quarter would support with some support , and more than 15 % support only because it is the candidate .
six % would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about their concerns .
the views are more mixed in those who do not support Clinton , only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 % of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less Republican voters about their top @-@ income 12th Five @-@ Year ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
agreement with problems and voter is also cited .
because the vice president raises a potential for the presidency for the presidency , 57 % of the Democratic electorate would see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not .
if democratic voters are asked to be asked for the Party &apos;s second election , Biden is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that their second election would be distant .
if he does not want to run for the nomination of democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s first @-@ round , ranging from 20 points on the race to 30 points without him .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters thought Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second step in this measure , but the percentage of which he perceives as a &quot; No stop &quot; is rising .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important among a candidate , Hollande &apos;s voters call about eligi@@ bility .
similarly , as last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates yield good results among their party &apos;s primary rights .
majorities consider Clinton , different , and Biden as honest and trusted , and with strong leadership skills .
Biden is at best on the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty % of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries also generally see Clinton , different , and Biden &apos;s ideological divisions with their views .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of America is now unhappy with her explanation , while only one @-@ third is happy .
public opinion in March , after the problem came to light , was divided .
most Americans said that the e @-@ E - CF@@ E ) - did not have a effect on her broad views of Clinton , although 36 % said that their attitudes have worsened .
they are mainly Republicans , more than six ten , say that their Clinton &apos;s views have been worse off .
62 % of eligible voters do not hold for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electoral vote is a tail@@ spin than not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and drama , however , receive good leadership .
of six @-@ party candidates , excuses , and Bush are best at best honesty .
a majority looks like dishonest , but , like any Car@@ son , many have no thought of him .
the margin of error between 3@@ 51 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son still moves across nationwide on the country &apos;s poll to the polls .
Ben Car@@ son is at the recent Inter @-@ New York University @-@ New York Times Times .
the two candidates now account for half the support of voters in the new poll , and others lose dramatically , and others lose dramatically , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support the country into large numbers , with support 23 % of 23 % in the last quarter of the last T@@ S &amp; amp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
but Car@@ son shot 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the poll also showed that Car@@ son is well off with higher education , with higher education , with higher education .
the former Florida , the former governor of the former Florida , the former governor of Ar@@ an , and Florida , and Florida &apos;s headquarters - Manuel Mar@@ Mar@@ co ante is at the third place in the third place .
the feu@@ tig@@ ation of 3@@ 76 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is a country or a cut of 6 % , and was carried out in September .
the recent London / W@@ IS@@ C , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the polls - for 19 % support for Republicans with 32 % .
the recent survey of A@@ Times / Washington @-@ Washington Post also highlighted a far @-@ reaching Car@@ son before Car@@ son .
looking at the last week rising Car@@ son last week , a few have been a few in favor of the former neur@@ ons , even after Car@@ son apologized to question in question .

five members of the Brotherhood are burdened by the death of a Mont@@ son College -
for nearly two years , with a student student comparable to a student student comparable to E@@ ami@@ o &apos;s Cro@@ o , Pennsylvania , death on five people will be submitted to five people .

Mr. Deng , after all , complained about a head@@ ache , then he assumed .
but they had the time to switch to Deng &apos;s clothes , his symptoms of go@@ o@@ sia , and , to paraphrase the country &apos;s national president &apos;s national president to catch up with advice , said in a press conference .
on this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide , hide the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ founded on what happened by Michael Deng &apos;s . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; quot ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
he could not be revived , and he died from his injuries on the next morning .
after a automobile report , Deng has repeatedly been able to be a blunt force in mind , ri@@ oting , and s@@ nat@@ ted .
moreover , many families have been destroyed by the killing of the Brothers ; at least one student has been destroyed by the harassment since 1970 . , at least a lawyer who represents the leader of Deng &apos;s family , a lawyer committed by Deng &apos;s family .
animals and its members must be held accountable , and this step is very important .
a Club of Mon@@ ro@@ e suggested a charge for the third of the third of the first five members .
thirty @-@ four members of the Brothers , including ID@@ Us , are charged with criminal attacks and education for criminal unification .
the Bar@@ ry College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brothers have resisted their affiliation with the local group .
that will happen if the Fed increases interest rates significantly .
interest rates will come , and interest rates will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long will take everything and how long .
in particular , history for the economy offers little guidance .
a recession occurred within only 11 months to the first rate hike and took over 86 months .
the Fed &apos;s aggressive aggressi@@ veness on the issue of interest rates is often not always a factor in how to respond to the economy and financial assets .
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that needs normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole bu@@ oy@@ ation may have been exaggerated because of interest rates .
by contrast , we will not expect the gradual return of the US - short @-@ term interest rates near too normal levels , but still at too low levels to become a near @-@ risk shock that many seem to fear .
but this does not mean that there will be no harm .
here is a historical trend on historical trends as some areas of the economy can respond :
as the market has seen last month , the exit of interest rate rates can be volatile for a long time .
as soon , the influence is not so dramatic .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to decline later and return to reducing the return of return .
recessions are a matter of economic life , but interest rates often promote interest rates .
in the current case , the Fed faces a few conditions that it did previously , and that could accelerate a recession .
what is hugely remarkable here is that GDP near the lowest rate of interest rates will be close to the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
according to the German bank , the 1@@ 18 % rate hike was only twice 4@@ 4.5 % since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % at 3.6 % , few expect that this will continue , and expected to expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rates on a so @-@ fragile economic background may be risky , and raise the question of &quot; this time , &quot; the German bank said .
market participants have made this year a year on the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were aimed at the G @-@ 20 &quot; s credit committee this week .
as many strategists and economists believe that the M@@ C could approve a increase in this meeting in this meeting , there is only 25 % probability of 25 % .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was observed in the observed period .
the current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and it has been so high for so far .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market was an interest @-@ rate hike , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first reduction @-@ reduction process is made in the cycle .
at the end of the driving cycle , bond yields immediately did the Deutsche Bank .
the strategists of Charles believe that the rise in interest rates will result between longer and shorter bonds .
interesting , it is said that markets have already been adapted to the Fed &apos;s post @-@ election strategy - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
but the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations has some signs that the market has adjusted for the prospect of tighter monetary policy ; it wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have been rising , the carbon race has widened , and volatility has been expanding - all of the characteristics of the market when the Fed exacerbated its strategy .
in large and all , companies will benefit the larger share of their business activity in the US if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse off , as an increase in their products on the global market is expensive , as well as financing their debts .
history - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; stocks tend to respond to three months after a initial interest rate hike , and Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs wrote - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
companies with strong balance sheets have been exceeded 5 percentage points after any rate hike in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital capital - paper and low volatility in their stocks hit their counterparts with low levels on average ( 2.5 percentage points ) and 3 ( six percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
with a high share of flexible interest rates , Goldman Sachs said .
outside the stock stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher returns , even though experts see how fast will happen quickly .

Internet - Con@@ economic fraud in August grew at the slow@@ est and the Black Fri@@ day can be held responsible for being responsible for it .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent in the online - the sale of sale .
last month , the lowest outcome since the records in 2000 was the lowest since the records in 2000 .
online rates - paper sales drove three years ago with the use of to@@ ys to buy cars three years ago .
experts believe that the Black Fri@@ day Fri@@ day in November has discouraged spending in November .
for more than a decade , the virtual sale has been booming , and many of Britain &apos;s major democracies have turned into ghost cities .

total spending on August identified the lowest increase in growth since the boom in 2000 with only five @-@ fold increase in 2000 .

the Black Con@@ - Con@@ day day - Con@@ ff day - Con@@ ff , which imported from America , is quoted as a cause for falling sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on the event that is taking place on last day in November .
last year , five five times picked up the average number of buyers about their computers to make up quickly , and some traders were deposed .
experts believe that the Black Fri@@ day , who want to be wa@@ ving out fast , might discourage buyers from purchasing purchases .

in 2011 , when a official investigation had started to investigate an official investigation in 2011 , a â¬ 1@@ 20,000 figure was on the issue .

the decision to let Adam Smith is , of course , to analyze me as his chief in Yor@@ sh@@ ire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are designed to produce results .
there were no question in Joe go@@ ot , for example , and that led to the nomination , as I have said - and I have said - players are their own best voters .
a long period would have been extended long ago , but he had the control of its own destiny .
if he hopes another two other airline purchases on the Yor@@ ire , another opportunity comes from .

it is a X @-@ - @-@ A economic platform - in a recipe that we saw at Yor@@ sh@@ sh@@ ire in this season , when he watched 2@@ 36 against us on a string of Bri@@ dge , which hit us .
he needs to gain at least the same opportunities such as those who will receive him but of course , of course , of course , of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea is to turn forward on the idea of what an Ex@@ cep@@ ted - in office - won &apos;t be able to be able to be able to make Bo@@ et@@ ler and four pri@@ bs , and I don &apos;t have to do so .
I do not see why a leader can &apos;t beat there , and it has already shown that he has been a Cat@@ ch of cricket - for example .

P@@ TA has a clear commitment to the public &apos;s information about what it has demonstrated , and what it is , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year on a disease with smoking , and smoking costs $ 2 billion per year .
the clear evidence of the latest evidence that E - CF@@ E is no risk - but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we will meet our national jurisdiction .

Mr. Zhu , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what is the solution ?
Mark@@ us of us are telling : the mass institution@@ alization in missiles or ge@@ ons has no sustainability .
for people remain a big part here .
given the refugee flow , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
a rare , three @-@ track rice is the solution .
Gil@@ ner : a rice squeeze is most needed .
it makes it easier to integration .
this is a different way when people get rid of homes .
each of the six houses that are currently built in the pilot project are composed of three asylum units for four .
each unit has two bed@@ room , a woman , a kit@@ chen , and a residen@@ atic fringe .
it can be that many people will be free , it is back again .
then the houses can easily be built at their disposal .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ ner : the cost of leading per capita homes on May 4 , no piece of land .
this is manageable .
six months have taken action .
that is appropriate .
have construction requirements complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ ner :
in particular , it is always the looming dam value of special space and the casual order .

it will still require at least three kilograms of cur@@ als , who is still subject to an increase in three homes .

in the last five years : the last five years had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but sophisticated workers have been trading , which can hardly afford to afford more .

just as it is clear , anyone who wants asylum turbines is bound to do so .

it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia does not want to contain the &quot; cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; ;
the Cro@@ an government had told me to go home to Slovenia from Austria to Austria and Germany , and to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so , for example , the Minister of the minister of the minister of California &apos;s interior minister was dying in L@@ ai@@ an .
the idea of cor@@ ors is tantamount to the idea of mutual vigor ; with Slovenia , the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - will intensify .
the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled .
but , as the minister of Ministers emphasized , he wants to leave its borders to refugees .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;

according to the media reports , at least a first place of roughly 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of the Serbian border , bus b@@ uses would be expected .

the detainees were removed from the near 500 miles away from the roughly 500 miles away by Serbia .

Croatia &apos;s Minister of the interior minister , O@@ j@@ om@@ ic , had stressed that his country has prepared for the case of a strong influx of refugees for possible circumstances .

it follows strict controls to qualify for membership in the underground area .
Slovenia has been this since 2007 , the EU &apos;s interim partners have since been a good news since 2007 , owing to the standard of border controls .
on the Serb side , behind the Hungarian border remains about 300 refugees .
according to the media of media coverage , they would have spent the night night on the border that leads to the border .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border s@@ wir@@ ers are falling off and B@@ is@@ i remains utterly closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go now is unclear .
it would not be a very high refugee act now .
it may not be said whether their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or another country would continue .

the lower prospect comes despite the price increases , which is averaging 4.@@ 9 % , and on January 4 , and , despite increasing haircuts for a severe and large package that will be levied on November 4 .

the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing the US Congress - restoring employment and prices stable .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed has acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
in the search of the search for a pretext to raise the interest rate , the increased insecurity surrounding the global marketplace remains sufficient to wait , but it said it said .
there is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which affects itself even the financial market .
about half of the economists who were identified recently have predicted an interest rate hike this week .
but financial markets expect a wait for the Fed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed is raising the line unless the Fed avoids the blow by promising promise that another increase is far from .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , the Dow Jones averaged 2@@ 8.@@ 7 or 1.4 % to 16@@ 21 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed was holding the phrase this week in this week , John Paul of London , the chief economist in Moody &apos;s ; Capital Markets Group Group Group Group Group .
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at that point ; he said .
if it does , it would have to do so in their statement to calm financial markets , lest they panic .
other experts argued that interest @-@ rate hikes would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month ago , the Fed seems to be seeking ways to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points earlier this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ue was in the spring and early summer , early this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the pleasure rate .
while job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed perceives as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation was constantly under the expected target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said , the Fed said that the main reason was the temporary impact of far lower oil prices .

but financial markets around the world ended the last month , after China devalued its currency .

the Fed &apos;s bonds - People &apos;s representatives often influence the complex calculus when interest rates should increase .
now he says that at least one month will be able to grapple with the impact .
the health of the world economy is none of the main beneficiaries of the Fed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed &apos;s Federal Reserve has become the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous in recent years .
the sheer indication of the then @-@ then IMF Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2013 is that the Fed could only wish its monetary expansion , triggering confusion around the globe .
their decision @-@ making is a more art : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;

one day since Satur@@ day has failed 16 - its first appearance of the Rhin@@ eland country - has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young wife of the young woman was found in rock &apos;s rock into rock mar@@ ches , such as prosecutors and police .
as a suspect suspect , he also is also a top 20 @-@ year @-@ old , Ju@@ de @-@ old , that was , according to the premise , and sent to the site of the bus .
the 16 &apos;s first @-@ year machine that was published on Satur@@ day on Satur@@ day was reported , having been reported on the eve on the eve on the eve on the eve on the eve after a one &apos;s visit to rock failure .
in the search for young women , the authors initially drew personal aspects of the victim .
on surveys of free @-@ aged and acquain@@ t@@ ances , after all , a statement for the 20 + age - ratified by the 20 .
the perpet@@ rator police led to a channel in rock , where the body was found .
according to the statute , the authorities have said that the 16 &apos;s 16 @-@ year bombings have been killed and kept the way to the channel .
the 20 &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old period should be led to the high ranking of six @-@ party agents that he gave him a burden .
indeed , some of the more likely circumstances will be to investigate further investigations .
refugees need : a study warning a housing gap .
the situation on the German housing boom is tense .
refugees are also searching for more refugees .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the rents in the German housing market have long been beginning .
with the end of refugees and labor from the EU , more people tend to push for a market that is already over@@ stretched in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens with high @-@ wage homes .
to cover demand for wages , five new units need to be built by 2020 .
the result comes to a study in the legal process of civil war .
compared to this year , in Germany , Germany will have 2@@ 60,000 entities .
it contains 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees , after the first three months of their education , are no longer required to live asylum seekers in a first place .
many are then going to the housing market , pushing for a long period of long @-@ run homes .
but the year held in the year of last year did less than half of all asylum @-@ seekers .
but the negative development of the housing market is not confined to rising refugee workers .
the study also made substantial failures in residential politics .
Germany has a housing deficit before year .
there is already about 7@@ 0,000 units in the ocean metro@@ politan area of 7@@ 0,000 units , lament@@ ing Mat@@ ter , the study .
many jobs have thus been killed in large cities in the W@@ G @-@ 8 - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
young adults stayed un@@ punished because of the slack in the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square meters per capita has been falling back in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance is pursuing a &quot; social housing &quot; ; a new start .
new incentives have begun to boost social construction .
thus , the extra @-@ cost tax revenues may be reduced , and the basic tax on @-@ subsidized homes will be made .
moreover , the Alliance is an attractive tax span .
the program of insur@@ ments of the state of state @-@ owned bank reserves is already well suited to cities and towns .

refugees are free : Croatia and Slovakia are free of free : Croatia and Slovenia
after Hungary , it is virtually impossible , because more refugees still elect the way about Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ s ordered to grant Cyprus to settle north to Slovenia to northern Cyprus .
but it is risky .
Croatia wants a neighboring country to construct the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
Re@@ stin@@ ation ; I talked with the Italian minister minister , and if necessary , we will become a cor@@ ri@@ dor .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria , and it is already the Schengen @-@ Green Movement .
the EU - not yet a Schengen country - is a Fau@@ et@@ aker country .
so hundreds of displaced people have embarked on Croatia to reach for Western Europe .
500 people have been infected with the border at To@@ ol &apos;s point , the Guatemal@@ an R@@ T@@ L was reported .
Hungary had suspended its border to refugees .
new laws that enter the same day are virtually redundant in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
the Cro@@ an and we have said : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
they are these people , women are women , children , and men who live and do something .
but people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Cro@@ an police had picked up the first displaced for Serbia &apos;s border with the EU &apos;s border with the EU &apos;s border .
most media reports report from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with both B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ s to the Serbian border city .
immediately after their arrival , they have sought to take root over the green border facing Croatia .
at the A@@ xis of Ju@@ et@@ ons , sub @-@ Serbian border are not confined to border divisions .
there are other dangers for this : there are still a sharp cut from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
space travel should quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border , there are no more refugees since closing the border .
by Tu@@ es@@ man , there were 3@@ 66 people .
on the eve of Mon@@ day , there were 3@@ 80 80 .
the new Hungarian laws will be forgiven to overcome and im@@ lay the border as criminal offense .

according to the Security Council , it was at the top on the border on the border ; in the border , all of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition to interest .
there are 13 children with small children , as well as two older people .
tomorrow &apos;s next morning would have been stopped there .
but no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
after all , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the fear of asylum @-@ seekers should be close to the top .
there was only a few hundred refugees .
they want to clean up to clean workers .
they drove the garbage that killed tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks .
road@@ blocks were removed and one area located in the border place was built .
no one wanted to go to the goal of this restaurant .
Austria can reach few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also increased its border controls .

the bridge agreement with the Bav@@ arian neighbors of Sunday &apos;s neighbors with the Bav@@ arian neighbors of Sunday &apos;s neighbors , at the very moment , was organized by the Union and Bav@@ aria .
it is a logical outcome of seemingly holy policies :
instead of participating in the camp camp , the government has officially supported our Federal Reserve , and publicly supported the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude to the heel of Nazism .
most of these policies are not just the Austri@@ ans now faced with chaotic conditions .
similarly , they will have to discover that the &quot; war &quot; ; promised to be invited and welcomed , nothing is another refugee camp .
there will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee flows and the next winter , with our human @-@ rights conditions .
and it will be greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .

it is too early to say it is too early to say that high weight @-@ added diabetes is more likely to live than those who do not have to be able to receive a surgical treatment .

they reduce hunger and limit the physical capacity to absorb food .
M@@ M@@ I I have a degree of weight with respect to size than normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 9 .

the average B@@ M@@ I , who took place , fell to 2@@ 4.5 to the fifth anniversary of this study by the end of the fifth year .
at the same time , M@@ I did not care for those who were not structured - bank @-@ like diabetes - for example , treatment treatments received roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical operation , 36 % of the diabetes diabetes was diagnosed , and at 28 % .
in the 1920 &apos;s , the medic@@ ological group , in comparison , the diabetes was fully accounted for only 1 % , and partly only about two percent .

after the operation , the average brand of physics sank 1@@ 9 % to roughly 6 % .

the research team also compared with average results in the two ways of the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
in the Swedish study , there was 29 people who took a di@@ ges@@ t in the Swedish conduct , for 29 % less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought more conventional methods .
although the new study does not have an advantage of the survival of the waste of I@@ et@@ ons , it was Blackstone Blackstone , but it was less reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I who is interested in the process .
the point of this study is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this bottom @-@ up M@@ I &apos;s group is lower ; without a threat of death or a kidney disease , she said .

he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be set aside from the interests of nations or even continents .
it also stressed that Western European countries &quot; reactions to the refugee crisis are admirable , but the situation is not appropriate .
moreover , it is impossible that every one can come to Europe ; he said his speech .
despite the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to address the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
ultimately , we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .

the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence , including George Bush &apos;s terrorist attack after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , and proved that the violent response of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events .
after September 11 th , I used my finger in a letter to President Bush , and I said that the way to resolve this issue is non @-@ violence .

a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to abandon my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the detainee , as he wants , and you gain access .
I complained with her .
they admitted that they have been able to do ; it would have been better , but they still think that it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ ag@@ p had had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not tell me what I write , and I would not do it , even if he would do .
I said that he was able to remove from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporters to write off there .
when he dies , he thinks that public debate will help the movement against capital punishment .

I cannot say that Richard G@@ it is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry &apos;s good support would be accused of him .

I believe that his execution is wrong .

the Federal Constitutional Court has issued a ex @-@ old judiciary , convicted of the judicial system of thumb , who was right for months to a small cell .
because of their human dignity , prisoners have a fundamental claim to financial compensation when they are in small cells .
that left the federal court in a high @-@ return meeting .
according to these , the judges can then hope only a few days into targeted sp@@ a@@ a@@ z : 1 @-@ 14 .
after that , the man who has now returned to a free ride has been brought to a larger cell .
his righ@@ tful condition for the un@@ worthy liability against the country failed .
but the Constitutional judge was the verdict of Kam@@ al Berlin , and the case for renewed scrutiny did not go back .
they see human dignity .
Kam@@ al court now decides about compensation for compensation .
even though , for legal reasons , there is only a few days of prison for which compensation is essential for compensation , it was meant .
otherwise , there is a fear of protection to fear of protection .
the cameras court now needs to clarify the scope of compensation compensation .
the Constitutional magistrates have often been empowered in the past .
so they spoke only in April to a convicted of prison , because he was imprisoned in a cell cell .
as a result , a decision in 2011 is that there is also the multi@@ doors of a cell without separate to@@ i@@ lets .
Kar@@ ens also confirmed the Berlin of Srebrenica &apos;s Constitutional Court , who had settled a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then @-@ called stimulus was between 15 @-@ 21 hours between 15 or 21 hours between 15 to 21 hours .
the Berlin prisons have made headlines in recent weeks in recent weeks .
prisoners will therefore be subject to 23 hours , who rise to the threat of aggressi@@ veness , even in order for the long @-@ term moment .
according to the Chief of the judiciary , 21 finds 21 who are not occupied , 19 is to fall away from 2016 .

roughly 800 asylum @-@ seekers will come to Germany after the House of the House of the House of Representatives this year , following the German Chancellor of German Chancellor Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) ) , even unable to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated the unusual challenge of the country &apos;s unusual challenge : &amp; nbsp ; I say again , and again again : we can create this , and we create it .
what is happening on Germany is the following @-@ extension .
what is needed is that there are between 3@@ 50,000 ( estimate ) between 3@@ 50,000 ( estimate of the National Security Council ) and $ 3@@ 50,000 ( estimate ) ) - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 73 ) .
dramatically , the shortage of homes have been at low marginal levels , but there are 30,000 volumes from the low @-@ cost housing price , and these especially favorable homes will compete for refugees .
Secretary of State Minister Minister of State , Minister of State ) will want to double production , from currently 18 million to a billion euros .
there is far too little in view of the P@@ AR@@ P@@ H : 80 countries would have to do annually , and would have to invest more than $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
moreover , scientists and federal ministers are in charge that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the Institute for labor @-@ market and professional research , it is likely to assume that the long @-@ term 55 % could be able to operate in Germany .
but , in Germany , refugees in Germany would not be systematically needed to help them to help them to help them , Andrei Clau@@ dia , the project of integration and education in the mountain of contention - a foundation .
but the integration of refugees is vital if it comes to Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the ad@@ ulation society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , according to migrants .
in Germany , there has been a political turnaround : labor migration for refugees to pay for work .
while labor migration was reduced to five months earlier , it was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the home closed , asylum @-@ seekers became marginal .
in society , as well as for technical and technical , the view that refugees should be allowed to become more market access to the labor market .
a major obstacle to market access to the labor market is missing .
so far , there is no abundant supply of education and education .
studies also show that jobs are common by personal contacts .
building networks is thus the royal way to work away from the roy@@ alty to labor integration .
to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita , the administration is being re@@ shuff@@ led in different languages .
if the demand for displaced persons rise sharply , the FARC &apos;s Senate would try to increase education capacity - for example , by offering more training schools .
in countries , students are prepared to classroom students without Germany &apos;s rubber classes .
but they are not always taught by highly educated teachers and teachers , as in Berlin , including those who have served only a qualification in English .
there is no shortage of reasons .
the German university &apos;s work estimates that about 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country has been banned or tolerated the study - the only exception has been until now until now , but so far has been a leader of Frank Frank ( CDU ) , but has now given his stance .
early refugees may be relieved access to high school .
for refugees with a road@@ blocks or tolerance don &apos;t get with the Department of asylum @-@ trading if they begin to study .
the latter are not a fan , because they do not fall below the circle of the le@@ mon .
no more patient refugees had to live for four years in Germany to be able to have lived in Germany - to be justified by January 1 , 2016 , shor@@ tening over 15 months .
but it also needs to be closed , but it needs to be closed , and , for science , economists call for science , as well as German students .
students should go straight .
Islam will play an important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the State was meant to acknowledge the same rights that churches have churches , and the existing state of Ju@@ et@@ ta - et@@ ch A@@ et@@ ch - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
it would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare state that is professional , professional for newcomers .
rights are also obligations .
thus , Islam &apos;s representative of Islam must agree on clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas , and to grant certain limits to control .
this also includes willingness to engage in religious fundamentalism .
the Chairman of the Central Kingdom &apos;s Central Intelligence , R@@ A@@ s Ma@@ z@@ z , once said , was the concern that religious conflict could be incorporated into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have their right to become too predictable , in Germany , in Germany , but he said in Bav@@ arian radio .
he proposed to exagger@@ ate the Basic Law of law .
integration will still be much more than a matter of society .
the majority of the majority society will also need to change the majority of discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European choices - has been an anti @-@ discriminatory and universal equality of law for a tiny decade .
but it is very slow to know how S@@ S@@ U &apos;s L@@ O@@ U was released , when the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
in general , Germany has been able to supply the so @-@ called Italian Prime Minister Frank Bar@@ om@@ ery .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
but additional money will have to flow for extra money .
to avoid scarcity , Roger Mont@@ nom@@ yrdin , who was calling for a Mont@@ nom@@ om@@ ery , called a g@@ ad@@ om@@ ery .
lost services could then be expected with the federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly questionable to feed so many people with a limited accounting bias that looks like the Free Trade Prize .
otherwise , doctors are particularly creating the language barriers .
so far , so far , the WHO has been proven to be more enlightened than other patients , migrants will be more enlightened than other patients .
it is not just in clinics , but they will have to be accepted by the program .
but many refugees have already been helped with more general medical services in the emergency attacks .
and with a other diagnostic outlook .
among workers , there is , for example , far more unequal disability , and the youth are about HIV - Re@@ formation .
but , with the partial illness of mental illness , German doctors came from their education but it took a Mont@@ nom@@ ery .
guns or tuberculosis are not so hard to detect ; and what the medical profession affects , perhaps by the people who may even be in sight .
the Syrians have a highly advanced education system , many people even are doctors .
to practice it , however , they need to be able to detect their skills and may be repro@@ ached .
at least half of the Dutch in Germany is estimated to be sick : most estimates suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , they are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , read a host of read , President P@@ K .
a recent study of T@@ ong Munich demonstrated that any five Syrian @-@ Prime Minister will be Japanese .
those who are experiencing post @-@ traumatic stress disorder are also at the same time with breathing , fraud , heart death , and death .
there are more symptoms - and concentration disorder , strong paternalism , and emotional do@@ g .
preventing the symptoms that symptoms would be chronic is that early treatment was necessary .
so far , only four percent of the mentally left are a psycho@@ therapy of psycho@@ therapy .
true , anti @-@ immigrant women may provide a request for chemical therapy , but it takes more than several months .
moreover , social agents would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to miscalculation .

moreover , the message comes from a number that does not reveal , but it has called for the 1960 &quot; s ; he told journalists after Mugabe &apos;s speech .

but , when you return to injury , you have a time when you have a time when you want to strengthen your body and combat combat ;
it is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body is confident , I am confident that he will do it , and he will be a career of the kind he deserves .

for those who are not suicidal , a circle of critical healthy friends has been hal@@ ved with the risks of mental problems .
but , of course , it needs to have even friends friends .
in the age of social media , with their emphasis on pre @-@ style , the in@@ adequacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong and successful , while in reality the isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call about social , social , social , social status , all of the costs of social values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship focusing on our mental health .
and , like a video match - invent@@ ors and billionaires - that money can &apos;t really buy happiness .
the beauty of veterans was that this focus was being raised .
each character was defined by his work , but by his personality , defined by the interaction of a friend .

Xi : K@@ az@@ z Gu@@ af@@ ola failed to change the P@@ FC in 2008 .
the world &apos;s World and Euro brothers have been playing since summer in Qatar since 2015 .
the FR@@ FC apparently faced a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s superstar star , who played back at the Sarajevo .
by the summer of the five 35 years , he died after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years after 24 years .

security ; I wanted to have voted for me .
recall : in the summer of 2008 , K@@ ew K@@ ew will be the FC .
Gu@@ ensi@@ stic ola was the reason that Xi did not change .
change did not occur .
and the most important figure for this is now for the German record champion : K@@ az@@ ine Gu@@ ol@@ ola .
Xi explains why : E@@ ok@@ a has been brought under the treaty , and I have played a grand E@@ M .
guns have said I have told me that I am not going to change that he could not be able to imagine the team without anyone .
but he was , with him a cure .

the dam plays a plurality in the movie .
in a dam , the African @-@ American film@@ maker , Benedict Brown , was able to talk about diversity and said that it was not needed behind the scenes .
in a result of a result of a result of a result of a result of a result of a result of H@@ BO@@ S &apos;s Project , Brown collapsed as the need for alternative perspectives , and in terms of a black protagonists in the re @-@ elected project .
but we do not talk about diversity ; if we talk about diversity , you do not do with the film &apos;s occupation of the film .
Brown responded , with abu@@ sive o@@ ods and called for ; Ho@@ o ! Mr. W@@ ay ;

to be sure , I want to ask people to think about - who will always be the director of the director - how to treat the figure of Har@@ ari &apos;s ; he said Brown first .

when debating the discussion was broadcast , the social media exploded about street comments .

N@@ EA@@ N@@ EA@@ L@@ IS@@ L@@ IS@@ A - The second half of the season was not particularly attractive for the Detroit tiger .
once one of the most successful teams in the bas@@ ves , the tiger in the American Empire was at the last place in the American League .
the Tiger have been reduced to their role in their role as a result of it , however , it did not play with the M@@ inn@@ ate with 5 @-@ 5 - 4 @-@ 4 .
the T@@ ho@@ ws wasted a chance for the rise of the Hou@@ ston of the Hou@@ ston of the second American League of us .
for Detroit , if only just one evening , it was a return of the three letter rates - written in the second half of the season .

Simon ( 13 ) ( 13 ) would hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 , and allowed three us .
it was only his third successful start in its last nine games .
but &quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to blame , and therefore , I want to focus on the game .

there was a color@@ ful case of A@@ H@@ H@@ on H@@ ic@@ an , and Simon brought his second safe score on Do@@ e to the head@@ ache before it was replaced by the left of Lin@@ win@@ ine Har@@ an .

Detroit has been a prelude to the play of the game by a non @-@ d@@ win@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ ar .
after putting in the first of the le@@ ff of the plane , there was a single one single of the Second bas@@ ons of K@@ enen .

the third N@@ ick Liber@@ zer was followed by a single right on the right side , but Victor Mar@@ ver@@ ez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .

no one , not technocratic - A@@ et@@ ch A@@ et@@ ch - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
at the start , it was the bu@@ bility of Ot@@ est@@ y , who has called for 150 of the same interpretations of bibli@@ cal stories on paper and L@@ HC .
his defense , with color@@ ful colors and fantasy , has received the 75 @-@ 75 years - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; amp # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
on the contrary , all of these issues can be quite grim .
for three years , German Chancellor officials have worked on his Bi@@ ves - the project for which he has made a subjec@@ tive meeting - commercial planners from the many issues of the property &amp; amp ; The book of all books .
there are cycles that address issues like fire , writing , or fa@@ therland .
he has spontane@@ ously been fascinated by several partners : this is true of the Sec@@ bility - de@@ ference to his theological sequence and for the US@@ et@@ ers - of his focus on art textbooks .
and , above all , the author of Klaus &apos;s post @-@ moderni@@ sm is set on the basis of the Mal@@ ens .
he has been interpreted by appointed directors on selected perpetrators , and so held in the current context .
these texts are like murky mirror of Al@@ ab@@ ry .
they are embedded between the original 1920 &apos;s - CF@@ T@@ le@@ z at Davos , and at the very least of the artist who is in charge of a personal thought .
the fl@@ atten@@ ing is a golden one .
for example , the 75 @-@ 75 truce allows a deep glimpse of views in his soul , its emotions .
this is a great deal of coherence .
but , since then , education did not have a stock stock market .
&quot; real , &quot; I have sought to work to work with your father again .
his second consideration is that the art is more concentrated in a mere night : &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
symbolism will be rec@@ ast .
artists have a different taste and wine to show things .
images have always been something strange and are not .
still , I am a d@@ inosa@@ urs .
we failed to grasp the Bi@@ ble , but to be selected for him important and obscure issues .
in fact , there was no cooperation on perspective . &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; Hi@@
for Hans K@@ Ã¶h@@ ler , the Prime Minister of the judiciary , this work has been an invitation ; his life is deepening and freedom .
Ot@@ mar Al@@ am@@ ler advocates both the ( bibli@@ cal ) language of love and the responsibility .
part of the original - paper paper - paper paper - paper paper and good models - is being presented in an exhibition set on November 15 in the Federal Reserve &apos;s - A@@ et@@ ch - that will be ratified .
the construction of B@@ M@@ X in B@@ X is approaching .
plans have been made in place , village companies , companies have been trading on a television course : one year later - but still before the official opening of B@@ M@@ X - on the road .
failures in politics and administration produced cra@@ cking , especially those who wished to tolerate the space .
thus , at the top , there is a new place - now with formal planning and motion for construction .
permission in October could be able to share the first public town of Z@@ umb@@ ine Z@@ ai@@ b@@ se@@ tin - Bo@@ ster Bo@@ ster now - with children &apos;s children and youth committee .
still , I hope that this year does not happen ; they said .
there should be a further theory of memory , with work at the former high @-@ carbon swi@@ mming .
F@@ F@@ B
the F@@ F@@ B will extend his commitment to refugees to 19 20@@ 19 , and the UK is a clear sign .
football responds to the deeper situation in Germany and ensuring its assistance for addressing the problems .
still , I believe this country &apos;s greatest challenge since unification .
in principle , no one can argue that I am doing anything to do so .
still , it needs to be interested in the issue on a gun @-@ to @-@ grab issue ; O@@ D@@ B B - won the leader of last year .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on February 23 , Berlin , he wants to be debated in Germany .
on the next few years , the National Security Council and the minister of State Minister Minister of State University have called for Prime Minister of State and German Chancellor .
on balance , the issue will certainly play a central role ; he announced it .
football can and wants to help .
but the critical driver needs to do with politics .
the German Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Exchequer of football - called for its General Peace Initiative - has been extended : zero for a Wil@@ l , four years .
some important religions support this program .
but , in the absence of the banking system - the foreseeable drama - no one seems to be able to see .
an old leader of Peter Bush spoke of a &quot; One &quot; list of the League .
at the end of the E@@ M , E@@ M &apos;s career with Hungary on this day , the national team of women is a national team .
for example , popular support for refugees called for a grand community of German football .
a great deal in her own places could have been launched in their own places .
so ny is that small and slightest times are active .
the message :
security ; it is an enormous meaning ; he said .
this year and the next year , the association with the D@@ F@@ B B , Elec@@ tion , and federal government will send â¬ 300 billion to the integration of refugees .
moreover , the whole sum of the whole whole was called for 2015 , once reported kidney .
reports - S@@ AP ) - were an eye for the accident .
the chief of Europe &apos;s great software , Bill Mc@@ Mc@@ Lieberman , has reportedly lost the left of the left in early July .

the 54 years old managers have been made at the meeting with the meeting of the meeting .
McDonald &apos;s machine announced a recent interview with the American newspaper ( for example ) that he will go to Germany after Germany , and continue to lead to software producers .
( I am ) ; I am full for S@@ AP , full in my jobs .
self @-@ understanding was an understandable , self @-@ understanding , with the Governing Council and his Chairman of his chair called for the type of state , said Fra@@ zer of the &quot; National Security Treaty . &quot;
Mill &apos;s mot@@ ons often oscill@@ ate between Germany and the US since the summer , but he was no longer held in the German S@@ AP - The mayor of W@@ art .
it is important to go with such a personal history of the public , said the managers of the state ; &amp; quot ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;

McDonald &apos;s Ar@@ ge , for example , has been the engine of the wind .
mag@@ nets presented a set of photographs and declared that he suffered injury when he was overthrown by the wheel .
thus , at the height of Singapore in Singapore , he did not look as much for the two live facilities for the two live facilities , as well as a week later , at the price of Japan .
in fact , &quot; B@@ L@@ B without a cure against riots :
in Belarus &apos;s ne@@ y@@ zantine village , all hopes for a comeback of Mar@@ co &apos;s first group in the first group of Europe in the first group of Europe .
the national players will be the top @-@ site football minister of football - indeed , in the Du@@ city with the F@@ K in the W@@ ay field ( 19@@ .@@ 00 ) .
but we cannot want it to him ;
given the high weight of his profession , it will not merely alter his te@@ el@@ o on the renewal of the re @-@ election .
thus , he announced a change of blame .
thus , it is a novel novel in the place of the most recent document .
dec@@ or@@ alism was called for an absolute term - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
it did , however , be an open question in the future of all Europe &apos;s presidential elections - the People &apos;s Congress - to do so .
the second factor will be high .
still , I believe that we have a good chance of violating the title .
ro@@ bo@@ ys : government wants for Germany to lead Germany for Germany .
Germany will have to be at the forefront of the government &apos;s will at the transformation of the country &apos;s technological transition .
the federal team was set on the y@@ oke of the Treasury Secretary of State Minister Alexander D@@ rin@@ sk ( CSU ) , which favors investment in building digital infrastructure .
on the top of Frankfurt , on the verge of the 1987 , G@@ IA@@ A was on the verge of a &quot; new &quot; campaign - an era of ages .
automated and related drivers would increase traffic safety and provide less safe leve@@ es .
he wants to ask the issue with its counterparts from the G @-@ 7 countries - for states that will gather with representatives of industry .
the Bank &apos;s second Strategic C@@ ap@@ ner , among the importance of mobile broad@@ band , has also stressed the importance of mobile broad@@ band - airplane construction and rapid increases in digital coverage .
as a result of new technology , a testing point now underway on a highway @-@ like highway in Bav@@ aria .
the driver ; no additional risk @-@ sharing will be created , but the federal government wants to review the regulatory framework , where necessary to adapt to the new developments .
for example , for example , Germany wants to use for internationally that the reckless maximum speed of ten cars is being raised from 10 to 130 hours .
the federal government also wants to use a change in the Vienna agreement , so far as a driver .
with automated travel , the car is increasing the lead that it will become more and more about passengers .
technology is based mainly on sens@@ ational and cameras cameras that capture the environment and process data in sec@@ onds .
according to the Economics ministry , highly automated work on highways and 2020 will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , electric vehicles are expected to grow only after 2020 .
the value added to the high value added to the high value added , and the highly automated drivers of the location of Germany estimate the authors for 2025 at around $ 8.@@ 4 billion .
moreover , the digital inter@@ oper@@ ation of the pound can lead to more security and efficiency in the road of road , and , in the 1960 &apos;s , Con@@ ff of post @-@ politicians are sh@@ umb@@ led .
but the issue of liability for accidents and the safety of personal evidence of driver must be clearly settled .
but the Germans still look - far more than French or American .
in France , 21 % of respondents lo@@ omed with a combination of seasonal cars , in the US .
in fact , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ employed vehicle .
according to a collection of the Chernobyl , only seven % would agree to issue control throughout the entire space .
the highway shops may , after all , reach 15 % , say , 45 % .
well , each worker would leave control under no circumstances .
Bolshevi@@ l likes to tell the team - and double in Ti@@ ber@@ e - &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ;

in the early days of the Great Recession , a larger role has been made away by the home industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a kidney .

at the very first time , the so @-@ called V@@ .@@ s , fashi@@ ons of past im@@ itation , is now a growing source of organization .

over the past 15 years , roughly 80 % of the shift has been broken .
private work and large trade trading are almost no longer .
our products are hardly enough to do so .
the factory in place nowadays is almost cheaper nowadays in the Asian space nowadays and almost everywhere .
exports will also weaken , now with Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
re@@ pairs are supplemented : &quot; it also applies to the safest materials . &quot;
a journalist zer , Gerhard Schmidt , tells the snow@@ ball of the West &apos;s post @-@ Western high school - in school for applied art - and has been specialized in diamonds and new ones .
to oppose competition from the Asian space requires high @-@ cost and innovative products .
this needs time and courage .
there is a flash@@ point between the most open @-@ earth ideas of the design@@ ator , and businessmen that have most economic ideas about economics ;
that is why an existing design is often easy to keep a consumer transition .

the initiative is important because it provides a greater role in allocating resources on the allocation of resources , a law @-@ right business environment , and making the market more open .
the government will also loosen controls over the companies on companies , and ensure that companies will decide how they do business .
the statement also told China to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
in the context of a supply of state @-@ controlled sectors , other sectors will be opened to private investment .

after doubling limits on emissions , there would be only 1@@ 4.5 % .
in exchange for this relaxation , the EU , according to the European Economic Outlook , wants to be able to increase emissions on average accounts for an estimated $ 1 million per hectare .
for example , Fo@@ od@@ y called this as a &quot; smart , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish , such as the use of so low , are so low that they are already keeping the planned highest levels .
