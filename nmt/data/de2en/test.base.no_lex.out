Obama is more receptive to Netanyahu .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not unique .
the two wanted to talk about the international agreement , as well as to the region &apos;s destabilizing actions in the Middle East .
but with respect to the conflict with the Palestinians and the most debated two states - RO@@ E states - are scheduled to resolve .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been shown for years .
Washington critici@@ zes Israel &apos;s constant settlement freeze and raises a lack of faith in the peace process .
by the Obama debacle surrounding Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has worsened .
in March , Netanyahu held a controversial speech - Congress &apos;s Congress held a disputed speech that was seen as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting pointing to the upcoming vote in Israel .

by the end of the day , there was another death : Lam@@ b took life .
a day after the upro@@ ar of the University , students and teachers , forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to create an image of what Lam@@ b was promoted .
the authors in both the State &apos;s two bodies , as well as those who knew him , helped create a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were seeking to classroom .
the police in mine , where he died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Chancellor Schmidt had a distinguished one in one of his written book in which he was the real man who held his academic lives .

at the same time , there were some inclination to problematic behaviors .
a student who praised a student , fire on space , the lam@@ b said , he seemed a bit too little , nervous , and nervous , when he was wrong with him .
a other student of other students , C@@ é@@ mi , said that Lam@@ b told him that he had to do with stress at the end of Ministers in 2014 .
Lam@@ b had previously had the province of State University on health grounds for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem .
by this year , he delivered only two online - for example .
recent changes in employment policies meant that the emotions that had been so hard for the lam@@ b did not guarantee him as an automatic path to a meeting that had been elected to be an elected professor .

8 % ratings show that Donald Tusk is serious .
some have sought to be convicted of him .
others dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republicans try to travel from the top ranks on surveys from the top on surveys ( but not yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national surveys demonstrated in double @-@ digit terms , and some begin to ask what it means for the opportunities of the nomination of real estate - &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45
of course , it is too early to succeed .
no one claims that the pendulum is likely to win the Republican nomination .
experts point out that this time has been raised in the run @-@ up of President Herman C@@ C@@ ain , none of which has won a government in the nomin@@ ating process .
there are many reasons why he would have a general choice .
but maver@@ ick groups like E@@ asi@@ ly Bush &apos;s C@@ PA@@ C and the conservative Economic Cooperation Club for Growth now now see their wealth wealth and begin to topple their dollar to topple him .
here are some recent public opinion polls that indicate that the real estate is not just a temporary phase :
Lee &apos;s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tusk announced his defeat in mid @-@ June , a public paper of Mon@@ t@@ mouth - Shin@@ e University - that only two @-@ thirds Republicans looked positive with the real estate of the real estate .
by mid @-@ July , 40 % was 40 % .
in early August , 52 % was 52 % .
now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of energy espionage .
about three ten say that they have negative negative opinion .
these numbers are in early states .
a p@@ ash@@ y hi@@ k@@ ata , a vote in Iowa last week , found that 60 % of Republicans have a good historical record .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ O@@ P P - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
in a paper of London / 7 C last week , 67 % of Republicans would either be able to do so ; they would be ex@@ ner@@ ed ;
only two of 10 say they would mean ; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as a tail@@ spin ( 43 % say it would be ) ; it would mean 40 % with 40 % , which is the same in a tail@@ spin . )
the next ?
Mar@@ co @-@ Baradei is 21 % with only 21 % .
on the other hand , the Republican Party &apos;s 47 % of the Republican electorate said that it was &quot; a dis@@ cont@@ a , &quot; or , if , if E@@ very Bush , the favorite of the establishment of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republicans is not a problem in temper@@ ament .
the same figure is true in the first electoral state of the nation , the Communist state , where the same 52 % of Republicans thought that he has a commander @-@ in @-@ chief figure , according to p@@ ann@@ y last week .
nevertheless , it is still 44 % that he did not have the personality to carry out effectively , and nearly six of 10 @-@ year bureaucrats say that his temper@@ ament is not the White House .
Republican voters accustomed to the idea .
when she we@@ ars their teaching , Republican voters are in real terms in real terms .
if asked who is most likely to be asked , who is most likely to win the G@@ O@@ P A@@ et@@ ch , according to a study from CNN and O@@ W@@ C last week , the best bet is to be the best bet .
this is a change since the timing of ten , when it was ten @-@ fold in July .

at this point at this point , ten ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win only 28 % for the final Mitt Romney .
nevertheless , the fact that a multi@@ tude of G@@ P - a multi@@ tude of O@@ P - seems plausible .
even if Republicans gather a different candidate , there is still almost every trend .
some pundits point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to a role of leadership , while the Anti @-@ Year Plan - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; called for more than a dozen other candidates .
but , at the beginning of the Mon@@ t@@ mouth that was written in early September , it shows that there is a hypothetical presidential election in a hypothetical judiciary - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp

the only candidate who follows him ?
Ben Car@@ son would then surpass the businessmen with 19 points on a hypothetical set of office - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
a narrow majority of Donald Kissinger , Ju@@ et@@ í@@ e &apos;s fic@@ --@@ have said that they have formed their views .
a recent survey of S / N@@ Y@@ T G@@ es@@ day shows that only slightly more than half of the electorate &apos;s voters say that they have made their votes clear .
of course , much can be done to change , and no one really can say to change the opinion .
46 % said that it can open the door to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , the most powerful competitors in the moment of other outsiders , the neur@@ ons of neurons run by Car@@ son Car@@ son , but voters who say they have their own have been double @-@ looking .
six of 10 Republicans say that they coincide with a conundrum on immigration issues .
since then since 2001 , since then his campaign in his campaign two months ago , Mexico was making a mockery of Mexico , which called for the immigration and cru@@ x of public discourse in the public .
some worry that the bom@@ bas@@ tic talk of scandal can be made by scandal - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
but , according to the new A@@ BC / post @-@ Soviet People &apos;s paper , ten Republicans say that they coincide with socioeconomic issues on issues of immigration .
so long as immigration is underway in the light of the light , it seems to have to do so .
frustration with the government is mounting on new heights .
according to Donald Tusk and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for half the support of Republican voters , especially by their outsiders - status .
ten of 10 Republicans say in the new Mon@@ day Mon@@ day - written by A@@ BC / e - that they want a political outsider than someone with government experience .
they are also angry at Washington .

the European Commission - which allows a new commission over T@@ T@@ T@@ del Commission - has begun a new court on the T@@ T@@ del court .
in addition to def@@ using the dispute on the planned transatlantic Free Trade Agreement , the EU Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbit@@ er system .
the controversial private disputes between corporations and states should thus be replaced by a more transparent system that is commensurate with a much more traditional courts .

it will be a second resort for the first time .
it would allow it to commit to the verdicts .
so far , the procedural choices involved was based on arbit@@ ers , a claim to their judgments .
in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens have become aware of the old 21 @-@ first failed system - and justice in fairness and justice .

Europe &apos;s Northern Revolution : Hungary preclu@@ des out of emergency rule , border the border .
Hungary declared the state of emergency , vet@@ ting the southern border with Serbia on Tu@@ es@@ day , and maintained all who tried to do illegal in the country , all of which aim to stop the flow of migrants .
chaos was followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants called for a kidney , and Serbian officials responded to indignation .
the people who fled violence in a country in a country in a country in a country on the streets between the two countries &quot; two countries were built and built on it .
but frustrations mounted .
when police helicopters invented them , the migrants are making ; the border opens the border ! &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #

( Serbia will want to be part of the solution , not a collateral damage .

the turmoil in the tempor@@ al , fascist Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ 28 nations - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; #
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the Continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not follow his hopes for an early action by Brussels or its neighbors .

former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ dip rally in the Democratic race in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie will never win on the ground .
Clinton now has received the support of 47 % of Democratic voters ( 58 % ) , while at the second rate , with 27 % ( a 17 % increase ) .
vice President Joe Biden , who has not yet declared whether he is running for the presidency , received 15 % of the Democratic majority of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months ago , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that it is too early to say what candidates will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more attentive than those of the other candidates .
since the CB@@ S - People &apos;s Press News Corporation - Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while some different profits have been made .
Clinton holds a big margin in women and moderates , but they have reduced the down@@ stream .
her support for men with men has fallen sharply , and there is only 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ orated , and they are now at the same point .
Clinton , however , has a big margin among the elderly .
last month , Clinton was at a different margin in the liberals , but no one has now been a 5 @-@ 5 @-@ year presidential election , at the start of this group .
for example , half of the Democratic electorates of the prim@@ aries tell me that they would support them with enthusiasm if they nominated the Party .
a quarter would support with some support , and more than 15 % support only because it is the candidate .
six % would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about their concerns .
the views are more mixed in those who do not support Clinton , only about a quarter would support them .
while 48 % of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , they say less Republican voters about their top @-@ income 12th Five @-@ Year ( 35 % ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 % ) .
agreement with problems and voter is also cited .
because the vice president raises a potential for the presidency for the presidency , 57 % of the Democratic electorate would see him in the race - though one @-@ third believes that he should not .
if democratic voters are asked to be asked for the Party &apos;s second election , Biden is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that their second election would be distant .
if he does not want to run for the nomination of democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s first @-@ round , ranging from 20 points on the race to 30 points without him .
fifty @-@ five percent of Democratic voters thought Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 % last month .
Biden is a second step in this measure , but the percentage of which he perceives as a &quot; No stop &quot; is rising .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important among a candidate , Hollande &apos;s voters call about eligi@@ bility .
similarly , as last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates yield good results among their party &apos;s primary rights .
majorities consider Clinton , different , and Biden as honest and trusted , and with strong leadership skills .
Biden is at best on the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty % of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries also generally see Clinton , different , and Biden &apos;s ideological divisions with their views .
on all of these measures , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of America is now unhappy with her explanation , while only one @-@ third is happy .
public opinion in March , after the problem came to light , was divided .
most Americans said that the e @-@ E - CF@@ E ) - did not have a effect on her broad views of Clinton , although 36 % said that their attitudes have worsened .
they are mainly Republicans , more than six ten , say that their Clinton &apos;s views have been worse off .
62 % of eligible voters do not hold for a honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 % of the electoral vote is a tail@@ spin than not honest and un@@ trustworthy .
Clinton and drama , however , receive good leadership .
of six @-@ party candidates , excuses , and Bush are best at best honesty .
a majority looks like dishonest , but , like any Car@@ son , many have no thought of him .
the margin of error between 3@@ 51 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son still moves across nationwide on the country &apos;s poll to the polls .
Ben Car@@ son is at the recent Inter @-@ New York University @-@ New York Times Times .
the two candidates now account for half the support of voters in the new poll , and others lose dramatically , and others lose dramatically , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters continue to support the country into large numbers , with support 23 % of 23 % in the last quarter of the last T@@ S &amp; amp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
but Car@@ son shot 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the poll also showed that Car@@ son is well off with higher education , with higher education , with higher education .
the former Florida , the former governor of the former Florida , the former governor of Ar@@ an , and Florida , and Florida &apos;s headquarters - Manuel Mar@@ Mar@@ co ante is at the third place in the third place .
the feu@@ tig@@ ation of 3@@ 76 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is a country or a cut of 6 % , and was carried out in September .
the recent London / W@@ IS@@ C , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the polls - for 19 % support for Republicans with 32 % .
the recent survey of A@@ Times / Washington @-@ Washington Post also highlighted a far @-@ reaching Car@@ son before Car@@ son .
looking at the last week rising Car@@ son last week , a few have been a few in favor of the former neur@@ ons , even after Car@@ son apologized to question in question .

five members of the Brotherhood are burdened by the death of a Mont@@ son College -
for nearly two years , with a student student comparable to a student student comparable to E@@ ami@@ o &apos;s Cro@@ o , Pennsylvania , death on five people will be submitted to five people .
officials said that he had been attacked with a 30 @-@ year paper - £ 5 @-@ pound - and repeatedly attacked , and repeatedly was repeatedly attacked , while he sought to go beyond a receptive field .
Mr. Deng , after all , complained about a head@@ ache , then he assumed .
but they had the time to switch to Deng &apos;s clothes , his symptoms of go@@ o@@ sia , and , to paraphrase the country &apos;s national president &apos;s national president to catch up with advice , said in a press conference .
on this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide , hide the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood &apos;s well @-@ founded on what happened by Michael Deng &apos;s . &amp; nbsp ; &amp; quot ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
he could not be revived , and he died from his injuries on the next morning .
after a automobile report , Deng has repeatedly been able to be a blunt force in mind , ri@@ oting , and s@@ nat@@ ted .
moreover , many families have been destroyed by the killing of the Brothers ; at least one student has been destroyed by the harassment since 1970 . , at least a lawyer who represents the leader of Deng &apos;s family , a lawyer committed by Deng &apos;s family .
animals and its members must be held accountable , and this step is very important .
a Club of Mon@@ ro@@ e suggested a charge for the third of the third of the first five members .
thirty @-@ four members of the Brothers , including ID@@ Us , are charged with criminal attacks and education for criminal unification .
the Bar@@ ry College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brothers have resisted their affiliation with the local group .
that will happen if the Fed increases interest rates significantly .
interest rates will come , and interest rates will fal@@ ter , yields on bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know how long will take everything and how long .
in particular , history for the economy offers little guidance .
a recession occurred within only 11 months to the first rate hike and took over 86 months .
the Fed &apos;s aggressive aggressi@@ veness on the issue of interest rates is often not always a factor in how to respond to the economy and financial assets .
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that needs normalization .
indeed , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants may find that the whole bu@@ oy@@ ation may have been exaggerated because of interest rates .
by contrast , we will not expect the gradual return of the US - short @-@ term interest rates near too normal levels , but still at too low levels to become a near @-@ risk shock that many seem to fear .
but this does not mean that there will be no harm .
here is a historical trend on historical trends as some areas of the economy can respond :
as the market has seen last month , the exit of interest rate rates can be volatile for a long time .
as soon , the influence is not so dramatic .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to decline later and return to reducing the return of return .
recessions are a matter of economic life , but interest rates often promote interest rates .
in the current case , the Fed faces a few conditions that it did previously , and that could accelerate a recession .
what is hugely remarkable here is that GDP near the lowest rate of interest rates will be close to the Fed &apos;s interest rate .
according to the German bank , the 1@@ 18 % rate hike was only twice 4@@ 4.5 % since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 % at 3.6 % , few expect that this will continue , and expected to expect only 1.5 % for the third quarter .
interest rates on a so @-@ fragile economic background may be risky , and raise the question of &quot; this time , &quot; the German bank said .
market participants have made this year a year on the Fed &apos;s interest rate , and all eyes were aimed at the G @-@ 20 &quot; s credit committee this week .
as many strategists and economists believe that the M@@ C could approve a increase in this meeting in this meeting , there is only 25 % probability of 25 % .
by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was observed in the observed period .
the current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and it has been so high for so far .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market was an interest @-@ rate hike , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first reduction @-@ reduction process is made in the cycle .
at the end of the driving cycle , bond yields immediately did the Deutsche Bank .
the strategists of Charles believe that the rise in interest rates will result between longer and shorter bonds .
interesting , it is said that markets have already been adapted to the Fed &apos;s post @-@ election strategy - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
but the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflationary expectations has some signs that the market has adjusted for the prospect of tighter monetary policy ; it wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have been rising , the carbon race has widened , and volatility has been expanding - all of the characteristics of the market when the Fed exacerbated its strategy .
in large and all , companies will benefit the larger share of their business activity in the US if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse off , as an increase in their products on the global market is expensive , as well as financing their debts .
history - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; stocks tend to respond to three months after a initial interest rate hike , and Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs wrote - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp;
companies with strong balance sheets have been exceeded 5 percentage points after any rate hike in 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 .
companies with high capital capital - paper and low volatility in their stocks hit their counterparts with low levels on average ( 2.5 percentage points ) and 3 ( six percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
with a high share of flexible interest rates , Goldman Sachs said .
outside the stock stock , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher returns , even though experts see how fast will happen quickly .

Internet - Con@@ economic fraud in August grew at the slow@@ est and the Black Fri@@ day can be held responsible for being responsible for it .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent in the online - the sale of sale .
last month , the lowest outcome since the records in 2000 was the lowest since the records in 2000 .
online rates - paper sales drove three years ago with the use of to@@ ys to buy cars three years ago .
experts believe that the Black Fri@@ day Fri@@ day in November has discouraged spending in November .
for more than a decade , the virtual sale has been booming , and many of Britain &apos;s major democracies have turned into ghost cities .

total spending on August identified the lowest increase in growth since the boom in 2000 with only five @-@ fold increase in 2000 .

the Black Con@@ - Con@@ day day - Con@@ ff day - Con@@ ff , which imported from America , is quoted as a cause for falling sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases on the event that is taking place on last day in November .
last year , five five times picked up the average number of buyers about their computers to make up quickly , and some traders were deposed .
experts believe that the Black Fri@@ day , who want to be wa@@ ving out fast , might discourage buyers from purchasing purchases .

the decision to let Adam Smith is , of course , to analyze me as his chief in Yor@@ sh@@ ire .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are designed to produce results .
there were no question in Joe go@@ ot , for example , and that led to the nomination , as I have said - and I have said - players are their own best voters .
a long period would have been extended long ago , but he had the control of its own destiny .
if he hopes another two other airline purchases on the Yor@@ ire , another opportunity comes from .
the England of England , for example , was prais@@ ing his attitude before Bav@@ aria , even though he did not have good achievements , and that is not surprising ; he is a team of office - &amp; quot ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; he was .
the question of how long comes a test of the test of a test of a test to put his mark is difficult .
Gar@@ th had received seven opportunity - like Sam be@@ d@@ son - at nine .

it is a X @-@ - @-@ A economic platform - in a recipe that we saw at Yor@@ sh@@ sh@@ ire in this season , when he watched 2@@ 36 against us on a string of Bri@@ dge , which hit us .
he needs to gain at least the same opportunities such as those who will receive him but of course , of course , of course , of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea is to turn forward on the idea of what an Ex@@ cep@@ ted - in office - won &apos;t be able to be able to be able to make Bo@@ et@@ ler and four pri@@ bs , and I don &apos;t have to do so .
I do not see why a leader can &apos;t beat there , and it has already shown that he has been a Cat@@ ch of cricket - for example .
his jobs may not be able to do his job for his credit value , but it is a number for them , and there is no big difference .

experts criticize the International Monetary E report - CF@@ Us of cigarettes .
claims of a government @-@ funded vehicle - CF@@ Us of cigarettes are less damaging than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly connected to the tobacco industry - predicted researchers .

PTAs released the &quot; Yes report &quot; last month , and it describes him as a &quot; No &quot; investigation of evidence .

a editorial published in the medical journal last month in the medical journal last month prevented the &quot; extraordinarily Indian base . &quot;

one of the 12 participants at the meeting were declared to maintain funds by a E - CF@@ Us of cigarettes - but not funding that he was told to have received from the tobacco companies of New York International International .
the reasons for the choice of members &apos; members will not be true , but they include several long @-@ known - fraud - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
some other participants participate in this meeting are not well known for their know @-@ of @-@ time reform in tobacco control .
the meeting of the meeting was also part of the tobacco - named P@@ TA .
but none of these linkages or restrictions in P@@ AR@@ E is discussed .
Mill &apos;s Ke@@ er and Ma@@ x@@ well said that , there is no evidence that there is no evidence that , there is no evidence that E was SARS - just as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers - were premature .

he said : &amp; nbsp ; D - CF@@ Us are significantly less damaging than smoking .
any other adult adult dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ E - are small - are small , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ TA has a clear commitment to the public &apos;s information about what it has demonstrated , and what it is , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year on a disease with smoking , and smoking costs $ 2 billion per year .
the clear evidence of the latest evidence that E - CF@@ E is no risk - but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we will meet our national jurisdiction .

what is the solution ?
Mark@@ us of us are telling : the mass institution@@ alization in missiles or ge@@ ons has no sustainability .
for people remain a big part here .
given the refugee flow , we need enough housing in the coming decades .
a rare , three @-@ track rice is the solution .
Gil@@ ner : a rice squeeze is most needed .
it makes it easier to integration .
this is a different way when people get rid of homes .
each of the six houses that are currently built in the pilot project are composed of three asylum units for four .
each unit has two bed@@ room , a woman , a kit@@ chen , and a residen@@ atic fringe .
it can be that many people will be free , it is back again .
then the houses can easily be built at their disposal .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ ner : the cost of leading per capita homes on May 4 , no piece of land .
this is manageable .
six months have taken action .
that is appropriate .
have construction requirements complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ ner :
in particular , it is always the looming dam value of special space and the casual order .

it will still require at least three kilograms of cur@@ als , who is still subject to an increase in three homes .

in the last five years : the last five years had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but sophisticated workers have been trading , which can hardly afford to afford more .

Croatia does not want to contain the &quot; cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; ;
the Cro@@ an government had told me to go home to Slovenia from Austria to Austria and Germany , and to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
so , for example , the Minister of the minister of the minister of California &apos;s interior minister was dying in L@@ ai@@ an .
the idea of cor@@ ors is tantamount to the idea of mutual vigor ; with Slovenia , the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - will intensify .
the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already heavily controlled .
but , as the minister of Ministers emphasized , he wants to leave its borders to refugees .

it follows strict controls to qualify for membership in the underground area .
Slovenia has been this since 2007 , the EU &apos;s interim partners have since been a good news since 2007 , owing to the standard of border controls .
on the Serb side , behind the Hungarian border remains about 300 refugees .
according to the media of media coverage , they would have spent the night night on the border that leads to the border .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border s@@ wir@@ ers are falling off and B@@ is@@ i remains utterly closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go now is unclear .
it would not be a very high refugee act now .
it may not be said whether their trip to Hungary , Croatia , or another country would continue .

the central bank has a double mandate of Congress : maximizing the US Congress - restoring employment and prices stable .
but since the Great Recession , the Fed has acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate : financial stability .
in the search of the search for a pretext to raise the interest rate , the increased insecurity surrounding the global marketplace remains sufficient to wait , but it said it said .
there is no consensus on what the Fed will do , which affects itself even the financial market .
about half of the economists who were identified recently have predicted an interest rate hike this week .
but financial markets expect a wait for the Fed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed is raising the line unless the Fed avoids the blow by promising promise that another increase is far from .
on Tu@@ es@@ day , the Dow Jones averaged 2@@ 8.@@ 7 or 1.4 % to 16@@ 21 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the Fed was holding the phrase this week in this week , John Paul of London , the chief economist in Moody &apos;s ; Capital Markets Group Group Group Group Group .
it would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at that point ; he said .
if it does , it would have to do so in their statement to calm financial markets , lest they panic .
other experts argued that interest @-@ rate hikes would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act .
a month ago , the Fed seems to be seeking ways to increase the phrase by 0.@@ 25 percentage points earlier this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ue was in the spring and early summer , early this year , despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the pleasure rate .
while job creation slowed in August , the improvement in the labor market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed perceives as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and , while inflation was constantly under the expected target of 2 % of the central bank , the Fed said , the Fed said that the main reason was the temporary impact of far lower oil prices .

the Fed &apos;s bonds - People &apos;s representatives often influence the complex calculus when interest rates should increase .
now he says that at least one month will be able to grapple with the impact .
the health of the world economy is none of the main beneficiaries of the Fed , so it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but , in effect , the Fed &apos;s Federal Reserve has become the world .
the central bank &apos;s influence has been enormous in recent years .
the sheer indication of the then @-@ then IMF Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2013 is that the Fed could only wish its monetary expansion , triggering confusion around the globe .

refugees need : a study warning a housing gap .
the situation on the German housing boom is tense .
refugees are also searching for more refugees .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the rents in the German housing market have long been beginning .
with the end of refugees and labor from the EU , more people tend to push for a market that is already over@@ stretched in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens with high @-@ wage homes .
to cover demand for wages , five new units need to be built by 2020 .
the result comes to a study in the legal process of civil war .
compared to this year , in Germany , Germany will have 2@@ 60,000 entities .
it contains 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees , after the first three months of their education , are no longer required to live asylum seekers in a first place .
many are then going to the housing market , pushing for a long period of long @-@ run homes .
but the year held in the year of last year did less than half of all asylum @-@ seekers .
but the negative development of the housing market is not confined to rising refugee workers .
the study also made substantial failures in residential politics .
Germany has a housing deficit before year .
there is already about 7@@ 0,000 units in the ocean metro@@ politan area of 7@@ 0,000 units , lament@@ ing Mat@@ ter , the study .
many jobs have thus been killed in large cities in the W@@ G @-@ 8 - &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp
young adults stayed un@@ punished because of the slack in the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square meters per capita has been falling back in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance is pursuing a &quot; social housing &quot; ; a new start .
new incentives have begun to boost social construction .
thus , the extra @-@ cost tax revenues may be reduced , and the basic tax on @-@ subsidized homes will be made .
moreover , the Alliance is an attractive tax span .

refugees are free : Croatia and Slovakia are free of free : Croatia and Slovenia
after Hungary , it is virtually impossible , because more refugees still elect the way about Croatia .

but it is risky .
Croatia wants a neighboring country to construct the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
Re@@ stin@@ ation ; I talked with the Italian minister minister , and if necessary , we will become a cor@@ ri@@ dor .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria , and it is already the Schengen @-@ Green Movement .
the EU - not yet a Schengen country - is a Fau@@ et@@ aker country .
so hundreds of displaced people have embarked on Croatia to reach for Western Europe .
500 people have been infected with the border at To@@ ol &apos;s point , the Guatemal@@ an R@@ T@@ L was reported .
Hungary had suspended its border to refugees .
new laws that enter the same day are virtually redundant in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .

they are these people , women are women , children , and men who live and do something .
but people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Cro@@ an police had picked up the first displaced for Serbia &apos;s border with the EU &apos;s border with the EU &apos;s border .
most media reports report from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with both B@@ us and Ta@@ x@@ s to the Serbian border city .
immediately after their arrival , they have sought to take root over the green border facing Croatia .
at the A@@ xis of Ju@@ et@@ ons , sub @-@ Serbian border are not confined to border divisions .
there are other dangers for this : there are still a sharp cut from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990 &quot; s .
space travel should quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border , there are no more refugees since closing the border .
by Tu@@ es@@ man , there were 3@@ 66 people .

there are 13 children with small children , as well as two older people .

it is a logical outcome of seemingly holy policies :
instead of participating in the camp camp , the government has officially supported our Federal Reserve , and publicly supported the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude to the heel of Nazism .
most of these policies are not just the Austri@@ ans now faced with chaotic conditions .
similarly , they will have to discover that the &quot; war &quot; ; promised to be invited and welcomed , nothing is another refugee camp .
there will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing refugee flows and the next winter , with our human @-@ rights conditions .
and it will be greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .

it is too early to say it is too early to say that high weight @-@ added diabetes is more likely to live than those who do not have to be able to receive a surgical treatment .
weight - Toyota &apos;s loss - sometimes structured operations , structured operations , or A@@ di@@ di@@ ve@@ tas , are using various ways to reduce the size of the gun .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical capacity to absorb food .
M@@ M@@ I I have a degree of weight with respect to size than normal between 18@@ 5 and 2@@ 9 .

the average B@@ M@@ I , who took place , fell to 2@@ 4.5 to the fifth anniversary of this study by the end of the fifth year .
at the same time , M@@ I did not care for those who were not structured - bank @-@ like diabetes - for example , treatment treatments received roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical operation , 36 % of the diabetes diabetes was diagnosed , and at 28 % .
in the 1920 &apos;s , the medic@@ ological group , in comparison , the diabetes was fully accounted for only 1 % , and partly only about two percent .

after the operation , the average brand of physics sank 1@@ 9 % to roughly 6 % .

the research team also compared with average results in the two ways of the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
in the Swedish study , there was 29 people who took a di@@ ges@@ t in the Swedish conduct , for 29 % less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that sought more conventional methods .
although the new study does not have an advantage of the survival of the waste of I@@ et@@ ons , it was Blackstone Blackstone , but it was less reassuring for people with a B@@ M@@ I who is interested in the process .
the point of this study is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this bottom @-@ up M@@ I &apos;s group is lower ; without a threat of death or a kidney disease , she said .
Blackstone &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;

it also stressed that Western European countries &quot; reactions to the refugee crisis are admirable , but the situation is not appropriate .
moreover , it is impossible that every one can come to Europe ; he said his speech .
despite the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to address the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
ultimately , we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .

the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence , including George Bush &apos;s terrorist attack after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , and proved that the violent response of the US drew a chain of uncontrollable events .

I must simply try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to abandon my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the detainee , as he wants , and you gain access .
I complained with her .
they admitted that they have been able to do ; it would have been better , but they still think that it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ ag@@ p had had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he does not tell me what I write , and I would not do it , even if he would do .
I said that he was able to remove from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporters to write off there .
when he dies , he thinks that public debate will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim &apos;s place , a journalist of the Hu@@ d@@ ton Post , will sit along with me .
if you want more about the case , you hear a series of po@@ i@@ es that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back on all details .
I cannot say that Richard G@@ it is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Bar@@ ry &apos;s good support would be accused of him .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not convicted of the murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and , from this perspective , I will die him .
I cannot claim to be truly objec@@ tively .
there will be other reporters that you can emulate .
what you get with me is what it is meant to see a man of unnecessary death .

this year &apos;s new comp@@ utation models have been presented this year .
one of the greatest news for the German highway is the option of a type that will be traded in the autumn of traders .

it is a core of the story .
by doing so , the new l@@ ump will not be much more expensive to do so .
option is a figure below the largest Mi@@ d of the Gulf , with € 17 6@@ 6@@ 50 euros .
the current l@@ 9@@ a cost costs 16 to € 16 .

J@@ V@@ A , J@@ V@@ A - T@@ elec@@ tive : five meter of cell is human @-@ spoken .
the Federal Constitutional Court has issued a ex @-@ old judiciary , convicted of the judicial system of thumb , who was right for months to a small cell .
because of their human dignity , prisoners have a fundamental claim to financial compensation when they are in small cells .
that left the federal court in a high @-@ return meeting .
according to these , the judges can then hope only a few days into targeted sp@@ a@@ a@@ z : 1 @-@ 14 .
after that , the man who has now returned to a free ride has been brought to a larger cell .
his righ@@ tful condition for the un@@ worthy liability against the country failed .
but the Constitutional judge was the verdict of Kam@@ al Berlin , and the case for renewed scrutiny did not go back .
they see human dignity .
Kam@@ al court now decides about compensation for compensation .
even though , for legal reasons , there is only a few days of prison for which compensation is essential for compensation , it was meant .
otherwise , there is a fear of protection to fear of protection .
the cameras court now needs to clarify the scope of compensation compensation .
the Constitutional magistrates have often been empowered in the past .
so they spoke only in April to a convicted of prison , because he was imprisoned in a cell cell .
as a result , a decision in 2011 is that there is also the multi@@ doors of a cell without separate to@@ i@@ lets .
Kar@@ ens also confirmed the Berlin of Srebrenica &apos;s Constitutional Court , who had settled a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then @-@ called stimulus was between 15 @-@ 21 hours between 15 or 21 hours between 15 to 21 hours .
the Berlin prisons have made headlines in recent weeks in recent weeks .
prisoners will therefore be subject to 23 hours , who rise to the threat of aggressi@@ veness , even in order for the long @-@ term moment .
according to the Chief of the judiciary , 21 finds 21 who are not occupied , 19 is to fall away from 2016 .

roughly 800 asylum @-@ seekers will come to Germany after the House of the House of the House of Representatives this year , following the German Chancellor of German Chancellor Si@@ g@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) ) , even unable to absorb a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated the unusual challenge of the country &apos;s unusual challenge : &amp; nbsp ; I say again , and again again : we can create this , and we create it .

this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 73 ) .
dramatically , the shortage of homes have been at low marginal levels , but there are 30,000 volumes from the low @-@ cost housing price , and these especially favorable homes will compete for refugees .

there is far too little in view of the P@@ AR@@ P@@ H : 80 countries would have to do annually , and would have to invest more than $ 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
moreover , scientists and federal ministers are in charge that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the Institute for labor @-@ market and professional research , it is likely to assume that the long @-@ term 55 % could be able to operate in Germany .
but , in Germany , refugees in Germany would not be systematically needed to help them to help them to help them , Andrei Clau@@ dia , the project of integration and education in the mountain of contention - a foundation .
but the integration of refugees is vital if it comes to Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the ad@@ ulation society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , according to migrants .
in Germany , there has been a political turnaround : labor migration for refugees to pay for work .
while labor migration was reduced to five months earlier , it was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the home closed , asylum @-@ seekers became marginal .
in society , as well as for technical and technical , the view that refugees should be allowed to become more market access to the labor market .
a major obstacle to market access to the labor market is missing .
so far , there is no abundant supply of education and education .
studies also show that jobs are common by personal contacts .
building networks is thus the royal way to work away from the roy@@ alty to labor integration .
to convince the family of the benefits of K@@ ita , the administration is being re@@ shuff@@ led in different languages .
if the demand for displaced persons rise sharply , the FARC &apos;s Senate would try to increase education capacity - for example , by offering more training schools .
in countries , students are prepared to classroom students without Germany &apos;s rubber classes .
but they are not always taught by highly educated teachers and teachers , as in Berlin , including those who have served only a qualification in English .
there is no shortage of reasons .
the German university &apos;s work estimates that about 20 % of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal country has been banned or tolerated the study - the only exception has been until now until now , but so far has been a leader of Frank Frank ( CDU ) , but has now given his stance .
early refugees may be relieved access to high school .
for refugees with a road@@ blocks or tolerance don &apos;t get with the Department of asylum @-@ trading if they begin to study .
the latter are not a fan , because they do not fall below the circle of the le@@ mon .
no more patient refugees had to live for four years in Germany to be able to have lived in Germany - to be justified by January 1 , 2016 , shor@@ tening over 15 months .
but it also needs to be closed , but it needs to be closed , and , for science , economists call for science , as well as German students .
students should go straight .
Islam will play an important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity .
the State was meant to acknowledge the same rights that churches have churches , and the existing state of Ju@@ et@@ ta - et@@ ch A@@ et@@ ch - &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp;
it would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare state that is professional , professional for newcomers .
rights are also obligations .
thus , Islam &apos;s representative of Islam must agree on clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas , and to grant certain limits to control .
this also includes willingness to engage in religious fundamentalism .
the Chairman of the Central Kingdom &apos;s Central Intelligence , R@@ A@@ s Ma@@ z@@ z , once said , was the concern that religious conflict could be incorporated into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have their right to become too predictable , in Germany , in Germany , but he said in Bav@@ arian radio .
he proposed to exagger@@ ate the Basic Law of law .
integration will still be much more than a matter of society .
the majority of the majority society will also need to change the majority of discrimination and racism .
Germany - as a result of European choices - has been an anti @-@ discriminatory and universal equality of law for a tiny decade .
but it is very slow to know how S@@ S@@ U &apos;s L@@ O@@ U was released , when the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive .
in general , Germany has been able to supply the so @-@ called Italian Prime Minister Frank Bar@@ om@@ ery .
&amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ; &amp; nbsp ;
but additional money will have to flow for extra money .
to avoid scarcity , Roger Mont@@ nom@@ yrdin , who was calling for a Mont@@ nom@@ om@@ ery , called a g@@ ad@@ om@@ ery .
lost services could then be expected with the federal countries .
and , in the long run , it is highly questionable to feed so many people with a limited accounting bias that looks like the Free Trade Prize .
otherwise , doctors are particularly creating the language barriers .
so far , so far , the WHO has been proven to be more enlightened than other patients , migrants will be more enlightened than other patients .
it is not just in clinics , but they will have to be accepted by the program .
but many refugees have already been helped with more general medical services in the emergency attacks .
and with a other diagnostic outlook .
among workers , there is , for example , far more unequal disability , and the youth are about HIV - Re@@ formation .
but , with the partial illness of mental illness , German doctors came from their education but it took a Mont@@ nom@@ ery .
guns or tuberculosis are not so hard to detect ; and what the medical profession affects , perhaps by the people who may even be in sight .
the Syrians have a highly advanced education system , many people even are doctors .
to practice it , however , they need to be able to detect their skills and may be repro@@ ached .
at least half of the Dutch in Germany is estimated to be sick : most estimates suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , they are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , read a host of read , President P@@ K .
a recent study of T@@ ong Munich demonstrated that any five Syrian @-@ Prime Minister will be Japanese .
those who are experiencing post @-@ traumatic stress disorder are also at the same time with breathing , fraud , heart death , and death .
there are more symptoms - and concentration disorder , strong paternalism , and emotional do@@ g .
preventing the symptoms that symptoms would be chronic is that early treatment was necessary .
so far , only four percent of the mentally left are a psycho@@ therapy of psycho@@ therapy .
true , anti @-@ immigrant women may provide a request for chemical therapy , but it takes more than several months .
moreover , social agents would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to miscalculation .

in the age of social media , with their emphasis on pre @-@ style , the in@@ adequacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong and successful , while in reality the isolation dominates isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call about social , social , social , social status , all of the costs of social values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship focusing on our mental health .

the T@@ ho@@ ws wasted a chance for the rise of the Hou@@ ston of the Hou@@ ston of the second American League of us .
for Detroit , if only just one evening , it was a return of the three letter rates - written in the second half of the season .

Simon ( 13 ) ( 13 ) would hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 , and allowed three us .
it was only his third successful start in its last nine games .
